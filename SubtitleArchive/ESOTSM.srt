1
00:01:34,048 --> 00:01:36,573
Montauk train on track B.

2
00:01:36,651 --> 00:01:40,985
Random thoughts for Valentine's Day, 2004.

3
00:01:42,389 --> 00:01:45,324
Today is a holiday invented by greeting card companies...
 
4
00:01:45,392 --> 00:01:47,326
Last call...

5
00:01:47,394 --> 00:01:49,885
to make people feel like crap.

6
00:01:52,565 --> 00:01:54,556
I ditched work today.

7
00:01:56,502 --> 00:01:58,493
Took a train out to Montauk.

8
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,570
Montauk train boarding on track B.

9
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,434
I don't know why.

10
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:07,672
I'm not an impulsive person.

11
00:02:14,352 --> 00:02:18,049
I guess I just woke up in a funk this morning.

12
00:02:18,122 --> 00:02:20,454
I gotta get my car fixed.

13
00:02:20,524 --> 00:02:22,458
Hi. Cindy?

14
00:02:22,526 --> 00:02:24,960
It's Joel. Joel!

15
00:02:25,029 --> 00:02:28,988
Listen, I don't feel very well today.

16
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:31,000
No, food poisoning, I think.

17
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:34,559
It's goddamn freezing on this beach.

18
00:02:34,637 --> 00:02:37,197
Montauk in February. Brilliant, Joel.

19
00:02:39,976 --> 00:02:41,910
Page is ripped out.

20
00:02:41,977 --> 00:02:44,502
Don't remember doing that.

21
00:02:46,114 --> 00:02:49,606
It appears this is my first entry in two years.

22
00:02:58,426 --> 00:03:00,417
Sand is overrated.

23
00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:03,620
It's just tiny little rocks.

24
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,931
If only I could meet someone new.

25
00:03:16,943 --> 00:03:19,878
I guess my chances of that happening are somewhat diminished,

26
00:03:19,945 --> 00:03:24,541
seeing that I'm incapable of making eye contact with a woman I don't know.

27
00:03:25,651 --> 00:03:28,814
Maybe I should get back together with Naomi.

28
00:03:28,888 --> 00:03:32,188
She was nice. Nice is good.

29
00:03:34,225 --> 00:03:36,159
She loved me.

30
00:04:13,428 --> 00:04:16,261
Why do I fall in love with every woman I see...

31
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:19,198
who shows me the least bit of attention?

32
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,970
Hi.

33
00:05:02,172 --> 00:05:03,273
I'm sorry?

34
00:05:03,341 --> 00:05:07,004
- I just said hi. - Hi. Hello. Hi.

35
00:05:08,212 --> 00:05:10,737
Okay if I sit closer?

36
00:05:12,381 --> 00:05:14,315
How far are you going?

37
00:05:14,383 --> 00:05:16,172
Uh, Rockville Center.

38
00:05:16,219 --> 00:05:18,517
Get out! Me too!

39
00:05:18,588 --> 00:05:21,523
- Really? - What are the odds?

40
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,750
Do I know you?

41
00:05:28,063 --> 00:05:30,497
Do you ever shop at Barnes & Noble?

42
00:05:30,566 --> 00:05:32,693
- Sure. Sure. - That's it!

43
00:05:32,768 --> 00:05:35,134
- Yeah? - I've seen you, man!

44
00:05:35,203 --> 00:05:39,367
Book slave there for, like, five years now.

45
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,807
- Ah. I would have thought I would've remembered you. - Jesus! Is it five years?

46
00:05:42,877 --> 00:05:44,970
It might be the hair.

47
00:05:45,046 --> 00:05:47,173
- What might? - It changes a lot.

48
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:50,546
The color. That's why you might not recognize me.

49
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:54,280
- It's called Blue Ruin, the color. - Right. Yeah.

50
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,686
- Snappy name, huh? - I like it.

51
00:05:56,757 --> 00:05:59,157
Yeah.

52
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:02,320
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names.

53
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:06,855
Red... Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution.

54
00:06:06,932 --> 00:06:09,867
That'd be a job, coming up with those names.

55
00:06:09,935 --> 00:06:12,870
You think there could possibly be a job like that?

56
00:06:12,937 --> 00:06:16,464
I mean, how many hair colors could there be? Fifty, maybe.

57
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,566
Someone's got that job.

58
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:22,881
Agent Orange! I came up with that one.

59
00:06:23,748 --> 00:06:26,649
I apply my personality in a paste.

60
00:06:26,717 --> 00:06:28,651
Oh, I doubt that very much.

61
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:32,010
Well, you don't know me, so...

62
00:06:32,423 --> 00:06:34,414
you don't know, do you?

63
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,661
Sorry. I was just... I'm trying to be nice.

64
00:06:42,498 --> 00:06:44,489
Yeah. I got it.

65
00:07:04,051 --> 00:07:06,986
- My name's Clementine, by the way. - I'm Joel.

66
00:07:07,554 --> 00:07:09,886
- Hi, Joel. - Hey.

67
00:07:09,957 --> 00:07:11,957
No jokes about my name.

68
00:07:12,059 --> 00:07:15,358
Oh, no, you wouldn't do that. You're trying to be nice.

69
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:19,357
I don't know any jokes about your name.

70
00:07:19,432 --> 00:07:21,593
Huckleberry Hound.

71
00:07:21,668 --> 00:07:24,228
I don't know what that means.

72
00:07:24,304 --> 00:07:27,432
Huckleberry Hound? What are you, nuts?

73
00:07:27,506 --> 00:07:29,440
It's been suggested.

74
00:07:29,456 --> 00:07:32,661
Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin' Oh, my darlin' Clementine

75
00:07:32,926 --> 00:07:35,519
You were lost and gone forever

76
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,860
Dreadful sorry Clementine

77
00:07:38,049 --> 00:07:39,411
No?

78
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:43,386
I'm sorry. Just... It's a pretty name, though. It really is nice.

79
00:07:43,454 --> 00:07:45,445
It's, uh... It means "merciful".

80
00:07:45,523 --> 00:07:47,457
Right? Clemency?

81
00:07:47,525 --> 00:07:49,720
Although it hardly fits.

82
00:07:49,794 --> 00:07:52,092
I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.

83
00:07:52,162 --> 00:07:54,596
Gee, I-I wouldn't think that about you.

84
00:07:54,664 --> 00:07:57,861
- Why wouldn't you think that about me? - I don't know.

85
00:07:57,934 --> 00:08:00,164
I just...

86
00:08:00,237 --> 00:08:02,569
I don't know. I just, uh...

87
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,573
You seem nice, so...

88
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,665
Oh, now I'm nice?

89
00:08:06,742 --> 00:08:09,905
Oh, God. Don't you know any other adjectives?

90
00:08:09,979 --> 00:08:11,913
I don't need "nice".

91
00:08:11,981 --> 00:08:15,974
- I don't need myself to be it, and I don't need anybody else to be it at me. - Okay.

92
00:08:18,786 --> 00:08:20,811
Joel?

93
00:08:21,923 --> 00:08:24,153
It's Joel, right?

94
00:08:24,225 --> 00:08:26,659
Yes.

95
00:08:26,728 --> 00:08:29,162
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

96
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:32,721
I'm a little out of sorts today.

97
00:08:41,374 --> 00:08:43,308
My embarrassing admission is,

98
00:08:43,376 --> 00:08:46,311
I really like that you're nice right now.

99
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:51,214
I mean, I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm gonna like,

100
00:08:51,284 --> 00:08:53,275
but right now...

101
00:08:54,419 --> 00:08:56,410
I'm glad you are.

102
00:09:03,628 --> 00:09:07,792
I have so much stuff that, uh, I probably should, uh...

103
00:09:09,767 --> 00:09:11,962
- Oh! I'm sorry. Okay. - I-I'm writing, and...

104
00:09:12,036 --> 00:09:14,129
- No, no. I just... - Sure. No. That's okay.

105
00:09:14,205 --> 00:09:16,799
- I just have... You know, this is... - Okay.

106
00:09:16,873 --> 00:09:19,273
- Ohh! Hey! - Take care, then.

107
00:09:19,342 --> 00:09:21,333
Jesus!

108
00:09:34,289 --> 00:09:38,589
Hi. I could, uh, give you a ride, if you need.

109
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,594
It's cold.

110
00:09:40,662 --> 00:09:42,562
- Yeah. Okay. Yeah. - Yeah?

111
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,530
It is frosty.

112
00:09:44,599 --> 00:09:47,397
- You're not a stalker or anything, right? - I'm not a stalker.

113
00:09:47,468 --> 00:09:49,561
You're the one that talked to me. Remember?

114
00:09:49,637 --> 00:09:51,901
That is the oldest trick in the stalker book.

115
00:09:51,973 --> 00:09:54,100
Really? There's a stalker book?

116
00:09:54,174 --> 00:09:56,369
- Mm-hmm. - Okay.

117
00:09:56,443 --> 00:09:58,775
I gotta read that one.

118
00:10:03,243 --> 00:10:07,942
Look, I'm sorry if I came off sorta nutso. I'm not, really.

119
00:10:08,014 --> 00:10:11,415
Oh, it's okay. I didn't think you were.

120
00:10:17,356 --> 00:10:20,120
Did you wanna have a drink?

121
00:10:20,191 --> 00:10:22,386
I have lots of drinks, and I could, um...

122
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,394
Um...

123
00:10:24,462 --> 00:10:26,396
Never mind.

124
00:10:26,464 --> 00:10:28,830
- Sorry. That was stupid. I'm embarrassed now. - No, no, no, no.

125
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,891
Good night, Joel.

126
00:10:50,486 --> 00:10:52,477
Two Blue Ruins.

127
00:10:53,489 --> 00:10:55,286
Thank you.

128
00:10:55,358 --> 00:10:57,292
Drink up, young man.

129
00:10:57,359 --> 00:11:00,157
It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.

130
00:11:03,465 --> 00:11:05,399
I'm just kidding!

131
00:11:05,467 --> 00:11:07,458
Come on.

132
00:11:13,374 --> 00:11:15,399
You're kinda closed-mouthed, aren't you?

133
00:11:15,476 --> 00:11:17,410
I'm sorry.

134
00:11:17,478 --> 00:11:21,972
It's just, you know, my life isn't that interesting.

135
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:25,645
I go to work, I come home.

136
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,220
Don't know what to say.

137
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:31,223
You should read my journal.

138
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:35,785
I mean, it's just... blank.

139
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:39,092
Really? Does that make you sad or anxious?

140
00:11:39,164 --> 00:11:42,497
I mean, I'm always anxious, thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest,

141
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:44,502
taking advantage of every possibility,

142
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:48,506
making sure I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.

143
00:11:48,573 --> 00:11:51,064
- I think about that. - Yeah?

144
00:11:55,513 --> 00:11:57,447
You're really nice.

145
00:11:57,514 --> 00:12:00,347
- Ohh! - God, I have to stop saying that.

146
00:12:02,586 --> 00:12:04,554
I'm gonna marry you.

147
00:12:04,621 --> 00:12:06,555
I know it.

148
00:12:06,623 --> 00:12:08,784
Um... okay.

149
00:12:13,763 --> 00:12:18,462
Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.

150
00:12:18,534 --> 00:12:20,468
It gets frozen this time of year.

151
00:12:20,536 --> 00:12:22,697
- That sounds scary. - Exactly.

152
00:12:23,772 --> 00:12:25,706
I'll pack a picnic.

153
00:12:25,774 --> 00:12:28,675
A night picnic. Night picnics are different.

154
00:12:28,743 --> 00:12:30,574
And, um, we could...

155
00:12:30,645 --> 00:12:32,579
Sounds good.

156
00:12:33,648 --> 00:12:36,242
But I... I should, uh, go. Now.

157
00:12:36,316 --> 00:12:38,250
You should stay.

158
00:12:38,318 --> 00:12:40,548
No, I really... I'm... I...

159
00:12:40,621 --> 00:12:42,555
I have to get up so early.

160
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,557
I would like you to call me.

161
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,389
Would you do that? I would like it.

162
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,451
Yes.

163
00:12:51,964 --> 00:12:55,730
Wish me a happy Valentine's Day when you call!

164
00:12:55,802 --> 00:12:57,667
That'd be nice.

165
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,374
What took you so long?

166
00:13:40,442 --> 00:13:42,376
I just walked in.

167
00:13:42,444 --> 00:13:45,038
Mm-hmm. You miss me?

168
00:13:45,114 --> 00:13:47,344
Yeah. Oddly enough, I do.

169
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,350
Oh!

170
00:13:49,417 --> 00:13:52,352
You said "I do". I guess that means were married.

171
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,354
I guess so.

172
00:13:54,422 --> 00:13:56,890
Tomorrow night? Honeymoon on ice?

173
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:59,392
It's really solid this time of year.

174
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,325
Whoa! I don't know.

175
00:14:01,394 --> 00:14:03,328
- Come on. Come on. - Eee!

176
00:14:03,396 --> 00:14:05,330
Come on. Come on, come on.

177
00:14:05,398 --> 00:14:08,834
Whew.

178
00:14:08,902 --> 00:14:12,394
Oh. So beautiful.

179
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:15,573
Isn't it?

180
00:14:18,644 --> 00:14:20,578
Uh, don't go too far.

181
00:14:20,646 --> 00:14:23,410
- Whoo! Oww! Ow! - Whoa! Oh!

182
00:14:23,482 --> 00:14:26,679
- Are you okay? - Ouch! Fuck it.

183
00:14:27,752 --> 00:14:30,448
Ohh! Oh, my ass!

184
00:14:32,524 --> 00:14:35,459
- I think I should go back. - Come on. Come on!

185
00:14:35,527 --> 00:14:37,461
What if it breaks?

186
00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:40,464
- "What if"? Do you really care right now? - Huh?

187
00:14:40,531 --> 00:14:42,692
Come here. Please.

188
00:14:42,766 --> 00:14:44,495
Come on.

189
00:14:47,871 --> 00:14:49,805
- Ohh. - Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!

190
00:14:49,873 --> 00:14:52,808
- Slidy-slidy. Slidy-slidy. - Whoa!

191
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:56,140
- This is good. - Here, let me show you this one thing.

192
00:14:56,212 --> 00:14:58,305
What are you doing? Whoa.

193
00:14:59,782 --> 00:15:01,716
Come on.

194
00:15:07,689 --> 00:15:09,623
Think I heard a crack.

195
00:15:09,691 --> 00:15:13,457
It's not gonna crack or break or...

196
00:15:13,528 --> 00:15:15,519
It's so thick.

197
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:19,792
Show me which constellations you know.

198
00:15:19,867 --> 00:15:22,461
Um... Oh.

199
00:15:22,536 --> 00:15:25,198
I don't... know any.

200
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,904
Show me which ones you know.

201
00:15:28,975 --> 00:15:34,038
Okay.

202
00:15:34,113 --> 00:15:37,571
Oh. Here's Osidius.

203
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,584
Where?

204
00:15:39,651 --> 00:15:41,585
Right there. See?

205
00:15:41,653 --> 00:15:44,451
Sort of a swoop and a cross.

206
00:15:44,523 --> 00:15:46,457
Osidius the Emphatic.

207
00:15:48,527 --> 00:15:50,893
- You're full of shit. Right? - Nope.

208
00:15:50,963 --> 00:15:53,898
Osidius is right there. Swoop and cross.

209
00:15:53,965 --> 00:15:57,025
Shut the fuck up!

210
00:16:08,178 --> 00:16:10,112
Clementine.

211
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,410
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

212
00:16:15,018 --> 00:16:16,952
- Hey. - Hey.

213
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:20,079
- Hey. - Sorry to wake you, but we're... here.

214
00:16:21,257 --> 00:16:24,249
Ahh.

215
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:32,189
Can I come over to your house...

216
00:16:32,267 --> 00:16:34,929
to sleep?

217
00:16:35,003 --> 00:16:37,870
I'm so tired.

218
00:16:37,939 --> 00:16:40,737
Okay. Um, yeah. Sure.

219
00:16:40,808 --> 00:16:43,709
- Let me get my toothbrush. - Yeah. Oh.

220
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:48,037
Just...

221
00:17:04,563 --> 00:17:06,554
Yes?

222
00:17:07,632 --> 00:17:11,068
- Can I help you? - What do you mean?

223
00:17:11,136 --> 00:17:14,572
Can I help you with something?

224
00:17:14,639 --> 00:17:17,267
No.

225
00:17:17,342 --> 00:17:19,640
What are you doing here?

226
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:22,235
I'm not really sure what you're asking me.

227
00:17:22,313 --> 00:17:23,974
Oh.

228
00:17:24,982 --> 00:17:26,973
Thanks.

229
00:17:40,229 --> 00:17:44,606
I need your lovin'

230
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:52,441
Like the sunshine

231
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:59,216
Everybody's gotta learn sometime

232
00:18:02,243 --> 00:18:06,543
Everybody's gotta learn sometime

233
00:18:09,368 --> 00:18:13,668
Everybody's gotta learn sometime

234
00:19:14,783 --> 00:19:18,116
- We're looking for 159. - What number's that?

235
00:19:18,186 --> 00:19:20,120
I don't know where that is.

236
00:19:20,188 --> 00:19:23,123
Jesus Christ, you'd think they'd light the number, or at least put a number on...

237
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:25,124
- Is that him? - I think so.

238
00:19:25,192 --> 00:19:28,286
Yeah, that's him. Wait. That's him.

239
00:19:43,576 --> 00:19:45,567
- Hey, Joel. - Frank.

240
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,473
Oh, shit.

241
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:54,986
Jesus. The only Valentine's Day cards I get are from my mother.

242
00:19:55,053 --> 00:19:56,987
How pathetic is that, huh?

243
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,989
You're lucky you have Clementine, man.

244
00:19:59,056 --> 00:20:00,990
She is way cool.

245
00:20:01,058 --> 00:20:03,549
Hey, you got any big Valentine's Day plans with her?

246
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:08,364
No.

247
00:20:08,432 --> 00:20:11,367
Well, it's only a day away. Better make some reservations or something.

248
00:20:11,434 --> 00:20:13,561
Don't want to end up at Mickey D's. Right?

249
00:20:13,637 --> 00:20:15,571
McRomance!

250
00:20:15,639 --> 00:20:18,073
You want some fries with that shake?

251
00:20:18,141 --> 00:20:20,473
I have to, uh, go to sleep now, Frank.

252
00:20:20,543 --> 00:20:22,704
It's 8:30.

253
00:20:50,504 --> 00:20:53,268
Patrick, stop it.

254
00:21:10,456 --> 00:21:12,549
Ohh! Okay.

255
00:21:12,624 --> 00:21:15,058
Okay. Okay.

256
00:21:15,126 --> 00:21:18,493
Whew. Okay.

257
00:21:20,565 --> 00:21:22,556
Showtime at the Apollo.

258
00:21:31,508 --> 00:21:34,443
Shh, shh, shh. Hey.

259
00:21:34,511 --> 00:21:36,638
Quiet.

260
00:21:49,691 --> 00:21:51,625
Hey, Joel. What's up?

261
00:21:51,693 --> 00:21:53,627
Oh. Hi, Frank.

262
00:21:59,201 --> 00:22:02,967
I only get Valentine's Day cards from my mom.

263
00:22:03,037 --> 00:22:05,972
How pathetic is that?

264
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,974
You're lucky you have Clementine, Joel.

265
00:22:08,042 --> 00:22:11,978
Hey, you got, uh, any, uh, big Valentine's Day plans with her?

266
00:22:12,046 --> 00:22:13,980
No.

267
00:22:14,048 --> 00:22:15,982
It's only a day away.

268
00:22:16,049 --> 00:22:18,483
Better make a reservation or something.

269
00:22:18,551 --> 00:22:20,485
Don't wanna end up at Mickey D's.

270
00:22:20,553 --> 00:22:23,044
Oh, no!

271
00:22:23,123 --> 00:22:26,388
Yes! You know Valentine's Day is three goddamn days away! I want it resolved.

272
00:22:26,459 --> 00:22:29,587
I'm willing to be the one to resolve it.

273
00:22:29,661 --> 00:22:32,994
So I call her, and she's changed her number.

274
00:22:33,065 --> 00:22:36,159
So I walked over to Antic Attic, you know, to get her something.

275
00:22:36,235 --> 00:22:40,735
I thought, you know, I'd go over to work, give her an early valentine, and...

276
00:22:41,873 --> 00:22:43,807
You won't believe it.

277
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:46,639
She's there with...

278
00:22:46,711 --> 00:22:50,408
this guy, this really young guy.

279
00:22:50,481 --> 00:22:53,939
And she looks at me like she doesn't even know who I am.

280
00:22:54,017 --> 00:22:56,451
Excuse me?

281
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,182
Can I help you find something, sir?

282
00:23:03,126 --> 00:23:05,060
Hey, Clem-ato.

283
00:23:05,127 --> 00:23:08,187
Patrick! Baby boy.

284
00:23:10,533 --> 00:23:13,468
- What you doing here, baby? - Just came to surprise you.

285
00:23:13,536 --> 00:23:16,437
- Let me know if you need something, sir. - You look good.

286
00:23:16,504 --> 00:23:18,438
Hi.

287
00:23:18,506 --> 00:23:21,600
- How are you? - Pretty good. Pretty bored. Pretty tired.

288
00:23:21,676 --> 00:23:23,610
Uh-huh.

289
00:23:23,678 --> 00:23:26,806
- I so want what's in your suit. - Oh, good.

290
00:23:37,057 --> 00:23:39,355
Why?

291
00:23:39,426 --> 00:23:41,917
Why would she do that to me?

292
00:23:45,532 --> 00:23:47,523
Hey, does anybody want a joint?

293
00:23:47,601 --> 00:23:50,195
Oh, God, Rob, give it a rest.

294
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:52,204
Oh, God. She's punishing me.

295
00:23:52,272 --> 00:23:54,206
- I know, honey. - For being honest.

296
00:23:54,273 --> 00:23:56,537
- It's horrible. - I should just go to her house.

297
00:23:56,609 --> 00:23:59,544
No! No, no, no. You don't wanna go there, man. You don't wanna go there.

298
00:23:59,612 --> 00:24:01,978
Get off. It's too...

299
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,982
- Right. - Yeah.

300
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:05,984
I don't want to seem desperate.

301
00:24:06,051 --> 00:24:10,647
Joel, why don't you just see this as a sign, make a clean break. Right?

302
00:24:10,722 --> 00:24:13,850
Right?

303
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,994
All right, Joel, look, man, seriously.

304
00:24:18,062 --> 00:24:19,996
- Rob! - Here's the deal.

305
00:24:20,064 --> 00:24:23,227
Don't do that. Rob, what are you doing? No, no, no, no.

306
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,463
What's your fucking suggestion, Carrie? What's your brilliant, reasoned solution?

307
00:24:26,537 --> 00:24:29,062
You're gonna make this about our shit now? This isn't about us.

308
00:24:29,139 --> 00:24:33,200
I agree. It's not about us. It's about Joel, who's an adult. Okay?

309
00:24:33,276 --> 00:24:35,267
Not Mama Carrie's kid.

310
00:24:36,579 --> 00:24:39,514
- What are you... - That's your laundry!

311
00:24:40,983 --> 00:24:44,475
That's great. That's good.

312
00:24:54,496 --> 00:24:56,487
Okay.

313
00:25:03,437 --> 00:25:07,703
- What is it? - I don't know. It's some place that does a thing.

314
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,611
Good morning. Lacuna.

315
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:25,613
No, I'm sorry. That offer expired after the new year.

316
00:25:28,427 --> 00:25:31,521
Yeah, sure. We can fit you in...

317
00:25:31,597 --> 00:25:33,895
How about on the fifth?

318
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:37,366
That's a Wednesday. All right, great. Could you spell that, please?

319
00:25:38,636 --> 00:25:41,969
Okay, and we'll need a daytime phone number.

320
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:45,634
Great. Have a nice day. See you then.

321
00:25:45,709 --> 00:25:47,643
May I help you?

322
00:25:47,711 --> 00:25:50,646
- I'm Joel Barish. - Excuse me?

323
00:25:50,714 --> 00:25:54,275
I'm Joel. Barish. I have an appointment with Dr...

324
00:25:54,351 --> 00:25:56,285
Mierzwiak.

325
00:25:56,353 --> 00:25:59,652
- Here. Could you please fill this out? - I just want to talk to him.

326
00:25:59,722 --> 00:26:01,713
- You still need to fill the form out, sir. - Really?

327
00:26:01,791 --> 00:26:04,885
- Thank you. - Great.

328
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,894
I don't have a pen.

329
00:26:06,962 --> 00:26:10,056
There's a pen right there.

330
00:26:10,131 --> 00:26:12,065
- Good morning. Lacuna. - Oh.

331
00:26:12,133 --> 00:26:16,001
Oh, yeah, that offer. That's done now. That expired after the new year.

332
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:18,061
Mr. Barish?

333
00:26:20,441 --> 00:26:22,375
How are we today?

334
00:26:22,442 --> 00:26:24,376
Not too good, actually.

335
00:26:24,444 --> 00:26:26,378
- Boo! - Oh, my God! Stan!

336
00:26:26,446 --> 00:26:29,381
- Sorry. Sorry, I was just... - I'm working!

337
00:26:29,449 --> 00:26:32,748
Sorry. Sorry.

338
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,811
- Here, Doctor. - Thank you.

339
00:26:35,822 --> 00:26:37,756
You should not have seen this.

340
00:26:37,824 --> 00:26:39,815
I apologize.

341
00:26:43,696 --> 00:26:46,130
This is a hoax, right? I mean, this is Clem...

342
00:26:46,198 --> 00:26:49,031
- I assure you, no. - No.

343
00:26:54,439 --> 00:26:57,203
- Mm-mmm. - There's no such thing as this.

344
00:26:58,709 --> 00:27:01,906
Look, our files are confidential, Mr. Barish,

345
00:27:01,979 --> 00:27:04,447
so I can't show you evidence.

346
00:27:04,515 --> 00:27:10,249
Suffice it to say that Miss, uh... Miss Kruczynski was not happy,

347
00:27:10,321 --> 00:27:12,380
and she wanted to move on.

348
00:27:12,455 --> 00:27:14,389
We provide that possibility.

349
00:27:14,457 --> 00:27:18,518
"Miss Kruczynski was not happy and wanted to move on.

350
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:21,120
We provide that possibility."

351
00:27:21,197 --> 00:27:23,131
What the hell is that?

352
00:27:23,198 --> 00:27:26,133
Nicest guy she ever went out with.

353
00:27:26,201 --> 00:27:28,135
Oww! Fuck!

354
00:27:28,203 --> 00:27:30,637
God, Rob! Give it a rest!

355
00:27:30,706 --> 00:27:32,640
It's okay. It's all right.

356
00:27:32,708 --> 00:27:35,404
Carrie, I am making a birdhouse.

357
00:27:37,378 --> 00:27:41,178
What can I say, Joel? You know Clementine. She's like that.

358
00:27:41,249 --> 00:27:43,046
She's impulsive.

359
00:27:43,117 --> 00:27:46,678
She decided to erase you almost as a lark.

360
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,524
A lark.

361
00:27:52,592 --> 00:27:56,028
Why? Why? Why? Why did you do that?

362
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:01,362
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

363
00:28:01,433 --> 00:28:04,368
I'm sorry, Doctor. He just barged right in here.

364
00:28:04,436 --> 00:28:07,428
- Okay. I want it done. - I told him pre-Valentine's Day is our busy time.

365
00:28:07,506 --> 00:28:10,873
- Oh, th-th-that's... that's okay, Mary. - But there are people waiting.

366
00:28:10,943 --> 00:28:13,878
Mr. Barish, if you'd like to, uh... to come inside.

367
00:28:13,945 --> 00:28:17,506
- And, Mary, if you could take care of Mrs. Woo. - Yes, of course. - Good-bye, Mrs. Woo.

368
00:28:21,653 --> 00:28:24,247
Now, the, uh...

369
00:28:24,322 --> 00:28:27,257
the first thing we need you to do, Mr. Barish,

370
00:28:27,324 --> 00:28:29,258
is to go home...

371
00:28:29,326 --> 00:28:34,764
and collect everything you own that has some association with Clementine.

372
00:28:34,831 --> 00:28:37,061
Anything.

373
00:28:38,534 --> 00:28:42,766
And we'll use these items to create a map of Clementine in your brain.

374
00:28:42,838 --> 00:28:45,432
Okay?

375
00:28:45,508 --> 00:28:50,571
So we'll need, uh, uh, photos, clothing, gifts,

376
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:55,605
books she may have bought you, CDs you may have bought together,

377
00:28:55,684 --> 00:28:58,312
journal entries.

378
00:28:58,386 --> 00:29:00,149
We want to empty your home...

379
00:29:00,221 --> 00:29:04,555
We want to empty your life of Clementine.

380
00:29:04,625 --> 00:29:09,119
And after the mapping is done, our technicians will do the erasing in your home tonight.

381
00:29:09,196 --> 00:29:12,529
That way, when you awake in the morning,

382
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:17,036
you'll find yourself in your own bed as if nothing had happened...

383
00:29:17,103 --> 00:29:19,594
a new life awaiting you.

384
00:29:22,575 --> 00:29:26,067
Wake up, buddy!

385
00:29:30,782 --> 00:29:33,046
No, I'm sorry, Mrs. Sobel.

386
00:29:33,118 --> 00:29:36,281
You can't have the procedure done three times in one month.

387
00:29:37,322 --> 00:29:40,951
Well, it's just not our policy... How are you today, Mr. Barish?

388
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:44,687
Hello. I'm right here.

389
00:29:44,762 --> 00:29:48,960
I know it's an emergency and we'll do everything we can... We can fit you in on the first of March.

390
00:29:49,033 --> 00:29:52,469
Maybe you could talk to the doctor, a-and he...

391
00:29:52,535 --> 00:29:56,801
All right, so let's make an appointment. What day would you like to come in this week?

392
00:29:56,873 --> 00:30:00,309
- Mr. Barish. - Um, he's really busy this afternoon.

393
00:30:00,377 --> 00:30:04,336
Maybe tomorrow would be better. Around 12:15? Can you do that?

394
00:30:05,347 --> 00:30:08,282
February is very busy for us because of Valentine's Day.

395
00:30:15,224 --> 00:30:17,488
This is, uh, Stan Fink,

396
00:30:17,158 --> 00:30:19,752
one of our most experienced and skilled technicians.

397
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:24,321
He'll be handling your case tonight.

398
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,833
Great to meet you, Mr. Barish.

399
00:30:26,901 --> 00:30:28,835
My name is Joel Barish,

400
00:30:28,902 --> 00:30:33,464
and I'm here to erase Clementine Kruczynski.

401
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:38,568
Very good. Now, tell me about, uh, Clementine.

402
00:30:38,646 --> 00:30:41,171
Uh, I was...

403
00:30:41,247 --> 00:30:45,047
living with this woman, Naomi,

404
00:30:45,118 --> 00:30:47,678
uh, a couple years ago,

405
00:30:47,754 --> 00:30:52,987
and my friends Rob and Carrie invited us to this party at the beach... I don't like parties.

406
00:30:53,058 --> 00:30:56,289
Naomi couldn't go, but I went...

407
00:30:56,361 --> 00:30:59,524
and I, uh, met Clementine.

408
00:30:59,598 --> 00:31:02,590
I'm sorry.

409
00:31:02,668 --> 00:31:05,603
Let's start with your most recent memories...

410
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:09,265
and work backwards from there, more or less.

411
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,274
There's an emotional core...

412
00:31:11,342 --> 00:31:13,276
to each of our memories,

413
00:31:13,344 --> 00:31:17,110
and when you eradicate that core it starts its degradation process.

414
00:31:17,181 --> 00:31:19,615
By the time you wake up in the morning,

415
00:31:19,683 --> 00:31:23,414
all the memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared,

416
00:31:23,486 --> 00:31:25,511
as in a dream upon waking.

417
00:31:25,588 --> 00:31:28,887
Is there any risk of brain damage?

418
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:31,950
Well, uh, technically speaking,

419
00:31:32,027 --> 00:31:33,961
the procedure is brain damage,

420
00:31:34,029 --> 00:31:36,862
but it's on a par with a night of heavy drinking.

421
00:31:36,932 --> 00:31:38,866
Nothing you'll miss.

422
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:43,334
Comfortable?

423
00:31:43,404 --> 00:31:47,033
What we're doing here, Mr. Barish, is actually creating a map of your brain.

424
00:31:47,108 --> 00:31:49,440
Okay, let's get started.

425
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:53,241
If we want to get this procedure underway tonight, we have some work to do.

426
00:31:53,314 --> 00:31:57,148
I want you to react to these objects, Mr. Barish, if you will.

427
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,254
There's a good story behind this one...

428
00:32:02,322 --> 00:32:05,257
Uh, actually, Mr. Barish, I'll get a much better emotional readout...

429
00:32:05,325 --> 00:32:09,227
if you refrain from any sort of verbal description of the items.

430
00:32:09,295 --> 00:32:11,229
Just try to focus on the memories.

431
00:32:11,297 --> 00:32:13,857
Oh. Sorry. Okay.

432
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:20,071
Healthy activity up there again. Healthy readouts. Very good.

433
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:23,403
- Here's another object. - That's so...

434
00:32:23,475 --> 00:32:26,069
Next item. Okay.

435
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:29,579
Potato head.

436
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:32,912
Next item. Okay.

437
00:32:32,983 --> 00:32:37,852
Just focus on the memories. Patrick, do me a favor.

438
00:32:37,921 --> 00:32:41,254
- Hey, Patrick, do me a favor, will ya? - Yeah.

439
00:32:41,325 --> 00:32:45,193
Can you check the voltage regulator? What do we got there?

440
00:32:45,261 --> 00:32:47,195
- Uh, voltage looks fine. - Really?

441
00:32:47,263 --> 00:32:51,256
Well, I'm not wiping as clean as I like here. I'm...

442
00:32:54,203 --> 00:32:59,334
Well, uh, technically the procedure is brain damage.

443
00:33:01,476 --> 00:33:03,876
Check the, uh... Check the connections, please.

444
00:33:05,647 --> 00:33:08,309
Oh, there you are. I...

445
00:33:13,687 --> 00:33:17,748
Why am I... I don't understand what I'm looking at.

446
00:33:17,825 --> 00:33:20,623
Why am I standing here and...

447
00:33:20,694 --> 00:33:23,527
Oh, my God. Déjà vu.

448
00:33:23,596 --> 00:33:25,689
Déjà vu. This is so...

449
00:33:25,765 --> 00:33:28,700
All right, we should get started. If we're gonna get the procedure...

450
00:33:28,768 --> 00:33:31,703
underway tonight, we have some work to do.

451
00:33:31,771 --> 00:33:34,296
I'm in my head already, aren't I?

452
00:33:34,373 --> 00:33:37,706
I suppose so. Uh, this is about right.

453
00:33:37,776 --> 00:33:40,768
This is what it... This is what it would look like.

454
00:33:43,348 --> 00:33:45,282
Very good.

455
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,614
We'll dispose of these mementos when we're done here.

456
00:33:47,685 --> 00:33:51,018
That way you won't be confused later by their unexplainable presence in your home.

457
00:33:51,088 --> 00:33:53,352
Ah, there we go.

458
00:33:53,424 --> 00:33:54,857
- Patrick? - Yeah?

459
00:33:54,926 --> 00:33:57,588
- Patrick, can you check... - Patrick?

460
00:33:57,662 --> 00:34:01,120
- I'm getting some sort of readout of my own voice. - Patrick? Patrick?

461
00:34:01,198 --> 00:34:05,100
- Why are there so many wires? - A lot of equipment.

462
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:08,968
- Does that help? - Are you sure you set that thing up properly?

463
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:10,973
- How's that? - How are you today, Mr. Barish?

464
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,133
- There we are, Mr. Barish. - That's better.

465
00:34:13,209 --> 00:34:16,542
- I don't know if I like this. - Think I might try this, then.

466
00:34:16,612 --> 00:34:18,512
We're almost done now.

467
00:34:18,581 --> 00:34:21,709
Mmm. Journal. That would be invaluable.

468
00:34:21,784 --> 00:34:25,880
"I met someone tonight. I don't know what to do.

469
00:34:25,954 --> 00:34:28,514
Her name is Clementine, and she's amazing."

470
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:31,115
Whoa! Jesus!

471
00:34:31,192 --> 00:34:34,127
- What? What? - Come on! Careful! Step back!

472
00:34:34,195 --> 00:34:36,129
Just take it easy.

473
00:34:36,196 --> 00:34:38,027
That's fine.

474
00:34:38,098 --> 00:34:39,929
Let's not roach the guy.

475
00:34:43,403 --> 00:34:45,462
All right, you got that one.

476
00:34:45,539 --> 00:34:49,339
- This place is sort of a dump, don't you think? - It's an apartment, Patrick.

477
00:34:49,408 --> 00:34:51,672
Patrick.

478
00:34:51,744 --> 00:34:55,840
Well, not a dump, then, but sorta plain. Uninspired.

479
00:34:55,915 --> 00:34:58,349
And there's sort of a stale smell.

480
00:34:58,417 --> 00:35:02,979
Patrick, can we just please get through this?

481
00:35:03,054 --> 00:35:06,683
- We got a very long night ahead of us. Come on. - Yeah. Yeah.

482
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:14,190
This is the last time I saw you.

483
00:35:29,379 --> 00:35:31,313
It's 3:00.

484
00:35:31,381 --> 00:35:35,977
I kinda sorta wrecked your car.

485
00:35:36,052 --> 00:35:37,986
Were you driving drunk?

486
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:40,317
It's pathetic.

487
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:42,619
I was a little tipsy.

488
00:35:42,691 --> 00:35:44,625
Don't call me pathetic.

489
00:35:44,693 --> 00:35:46,627
Well, it is pathetic.

490
00:35:46,695 --> 00:35:49,630
- It's fucking irresponsible. Could've killed somebody. - Oh, God.

491
00:35:49,697 --> 00:35:52,632
- Maybe you did kill somebody. Should we turn on the news and see? - Oh, Christ!

492
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:55,999
- Should I check the grill to see if there's any children or small animals? - I didn't kill anybody!

493
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:59,938
It's just a fucking dent, Joel. You're like an old lady or something.

494
00:36:00,007 --> 00:36:02,441
Well, what are you like?

495
00:36:02,509 --> 00:36:04,443
- A wino? - A wino?

496
00:36:04,511 --> 00:36:07,446
Jesus, are you from the '50s or something?

497
00:36:07,514 --> 00:36:09,448
A wino?

498
00:36:09,516 --> 00:36:11,780
Face it, Joely.

499
00:36:11,851 --> 00:36:16,288
You're freaked out because I was out late without you,

500
00:36:16,355 --> 00:36:19,290
and in your little wormy brain...

501
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:23,351
you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?

502
00:36:24,964 --> 00:36:26,898
No, see, Clem,

503
00:36:26,965 --> 00:36:29,559
I assume you fucked someone tonight.

504
00:36:29,634 --> 00:36:32,068
Isn't that how you get people to like you?

505
00:36:41,878 --> 00:36:45,314
I'm sorry. Okay?

506
00:36:45,382 --> 00:36:48,215
Clem, I didn't mean it. All right?

507
00:36:53,723 --> 00:36:55,657
- Clem? - Your keys.

508
00:36:55,725 --> 00:36:58,660
- I was just... I was just... - I won't need them anymore.

509
00:36:58,728 --> 00:37:01,822
Angry or annoyed or something, I don't know.

510
00:37:08,536 --> 00:37:10,527
Clem?

511
00:37:12,907 --> 00:37:15,501
Got it.

512
00:37:15,576 --> 00:37:17,510
Mary's coming over tonight.

513
00:37:17,578 --> 00:37:19,205
- Yeah? - Yeah.

514
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:21,213
Just thought you'd wanna know.

515
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:24,307
I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me.

516
00:37:24,385 --> 00:37:26,945
She likes you okay.

517
00:37:27,021 --> 00:37:30,115
So, maybe I should invite my girlfriend over. I have a girlfriend now.

518
00:37:30,189 --> 00:37:32,714
- Do whatever you want. - Did I tell you I have...

519
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,726
Yeah.

520
00:37:39,699 --> 00:37:42,133
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?

521
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,134
We gotta focus here, Patrick.

522
00:37:44,202 --> 00:37:46,136
Yeah, the thing is,

523
00:37:46,204 --> 00:37:49,105
our situation is... is a little weird.

524
00:37:49,174 --> 00:37:51,165
My girlfriend situation.

525
00:37:52,243 --> 00:37:54,040
I'm sure it is.

526
00:37:54,111 --> 00:37:56,102
You gotta be...

527
00:38:22,171 --> 00:38:24,105
Clem, let me drive you home.

528
00:38:24,173 --> 00:38:26,266
Get out of my face, faggot!

529
00:38:27,643 --> 00:38:31,238
Look at it out here! It's all falling apart!

530
00:38:31,312 --> 00:38:33,678
I'm erasing you, and I'm happy!

531
00:38:33,748 --> 00:38:35,682
You did it to me first!

532
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:39,743
I can't believe you did this to me. Goddamn it.

533
00:38:39,821 --> 00:38:42,756
Clem! Can you hear me?

534
00:38:42,823 --> 00:38:45,417
By morning you'll be gone!

535
00:38:45,492 --> 00:38:48,984
The perfect ending to this piece-of-shit story!

536
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:57,796
Is there something wrong with a girl being attracted to me? Is that a problem?

537
00:38:57,870 --> 00:39:00,395
No, I think it's... funny.

538
00:39:00,473 --> 00:39:03,567
So, who do you think's better-looking, me or this guy?

539
00:39:03,642 --> 00:39:05,576
Patrick, let's focus, buddy.

540
00:39:05,644 --> 00:39:08,238
Remember that girl we did last week?

541
00:39:08,313 --> 00:39:11,441
The one with the... potatoes?

542
00:39:13,151 --> 00:39:16,587
That girl? That's this guy's girl.

543
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:18,588
- Right. - Yeah.

544
00:39:18,655 --> 00:39:21,590
Was. We took care of that.

545
00:39:21,658 --> 00:39:24,149
- Oh, God! - Well, uh...

546
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:27,095
I kinda fell in love with her that night.

547
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:30,099
What? You little fuck...

548
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:33,159
- What? - She was unconscious, man.

549
00:39:33,236 --> 00:39:36,262
Well, she was beautiful, and...

550
00:39:36,339 --> 00:39:39,331
I stole a pair of her panties as well.

551
00:39:42,245 --> 00:39:44,179
- Jesus! - What?

552
00:39:44,246 --> 00:39:46,180
It's not like...

553
00:39:45,748 --> 00:39:48,740
- I mean, they were clean and all. - Don't tell me this stuff, man! I don't wanna hear this shit!

554
00:39:48,817 --> 00:39:51,251
- They were clean! - What? D-Don't! Stop!

555
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,754
- Okay. Yeah! All right! - We got work to do.

556
00:39:53,822 --> 00:39:55,813
Give me my papers.

557
00:40:09,269 --> 00:40:11,703
There's, um...

558
00:40:13,073 --> 00:40:15,064
There's more.

559
00:40:16,243 --> 00:40:19,178
After we did her, I kind of...

560
00:40:19,246 --> 00:40:22,647
went to where she works and asked her out.

561
00:40:24,383 --> 00:40:26,044
You what?

562
00:40:26,118 --> 00:40:28,746
- Jesus. - Jesus, Patrick!

563
00:40:29,755 --> 00:40:32,781
Do you have... any idea...

564
00:40:32,857 --> 00:40:34,688
how unethical...

565
00:40:34,759 --> 00:40:37,694
It's not really that bad.

566
00:40:37,762 --> 00:40:40,492
What? Get that look off your face. What's wrong?

567
00:40:40,565 --> 00:40:43,864
Patrick, you stole a girl's panties!

568
00:40:55,179 --> 00:40:57,170
There's someone here.

569
00:40:58,214 --> 00:41:00,148
He stole your underwear.

570
00:41:01,217 --> 00:41:04,380
I don't see anyone.

571
00:41:19,901 --> 00:41:22,927
Joel?

572
00:41:23,003 --> 00:41:25,403
Where are my boots?

573
00:41:25,473 --> 00:41:28,931
Why are you showing me poisons? Can't you understand English?

574
00:41:29,009 --> 00:41:32,001
"Potions", I said. Potions.

575
00:41:37,951 --> 00:41:40,385
Love potion, please.

576
00:41:40,453 --> 00:41:43,354
I'm fucking crawling out of my skin!

577
00:41:46,493 --> 00:41:48,984
Should've left you at the flea market.

578
00:41:50,329 --> 00:41:53,298
First thing to do is...

579
00:41:53,365 --> 00:41:56,357
sift in a cup of powdered whale heart.

580
00:42:01,606 --> 00:42:03,767
Wanna go?

581
00:42:05,143 --> 00:42:07,077
I want to have a baby.

582
00:42:07,145 --> 00:42:10,046
Let's talk about it later.

583
00:42:10,114 --> 00:42:13,277
No! I want to have a baby.

584
00:42:14,417 --> 00:42:17,352
I don't think we're ready.

585
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:19,445
You're not ready.

586
00:42:19,523 --> 00:42:22,754
Clem, do you really think you could take care of a kid?

587
00:42:22,826 --> 00:42:24,987
What?

588
00:42:26,495 --> 00:42:28,929
I don't wanna talk about it here.

589
00:42:28,998 --> 00:42:31,762
I can't hear you. I can never the fuck understand what you're saying.

590
00:42:31,834 --> 00:42:34,268
- I don't wanna talk about this! - Fucking ventriloquist!

591
00:42:34,336 --> 00:42:36,770
- We're fucking gonna talk about it! - I... don't... want... to...

592
00:42:36,838 --> 00:42:39,432
You can't just say something like that and say you don't wanna talk about it!

593
00:42:39,507 --> 00:42:42,442
- I'm sorry, Clem. - I'd make a fucking good mother!

594
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:46,947
- I love children, I'm creative and smart and I'd make a fucking great mother! - Oh, God... Mmm!

595
00:42:47,015 --> 00:42:50,382
It's you, Joel. It's you who can't commit to anything!

596
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:54,147
- It's going! It's going! - You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you!

597
00:42:54,221 --> 00:42:57,156
Maybe I should end this right here, Joel!

598
00:42:57,224 --> 00:43:00,591
- Leave you at the flea market with this stupid costume jewelry! - It's done. This is crap.

599
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:04,153
- Maybe you could find yourself an antique rocking chair to die in! - All the pain, confusion...

600
00:43:12,071 --> 00:43:14,767
- Oh. Hi, Patrick. - Hi, Mary. How's it goin'?

601
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,775
- Hey, you. - Oh, it's freezing outside.

602
00:43:17,843 --> 00:43:19,674
- Find us okay? - Yeah.

603
00:43:23,048 --> 00:43:25,539
- Mmm. - Hot!

604
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:28,684
Poor guy.

605
00:43:28,752 --> 00:43:31,482
Mmm? Oh.

606
00:43:31,555 --> 00:43:33,785
Don't you have anything real to drink?

607
00:43:33,858 --> 00:43:36,793
Uh, we haven't really checked yet.

608
00:43:36,861 --> 00:43:38,795
- Patrick? - Uh, yeah.

609
00:43:38,862 --> 00:43:41,262
Uh, let me do the honors.

610
00:43:42,565 --> 00:43:44,499
Mary hates me.

611
00:43:44,567 --> 00:43:47,229
Never really had much luck with the ladies.

612
00:43:47,303 --> 00:43:49,237
Maybe if you stop stealing their panties.

613
00:43:49,305 --> 00:43:52,331
Stan. Stan.

614
00:43:52,407 --> 00:43:53,840
- There's more. - No!

615
00:43:53,909 --> 00:43:55,206
- Yes. - No!

616
00:43:55,277 --> 00:43:59,179
Hey, hey!

617
00:43:59,248 --> 00:44:02,183
Oh, you didn't want any, did you, Patrick?

618
00:44:02,251 --> 00:44:04,845
- Uh, no, that's okay. - Wait.

619
00:44:04,919 --> 00:44:09,219
"Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."

620
00:44:11,292 --> 00:44:13,226
Oh.

621
00:44:13,294 --> 00:44:15,228
- Oh! - Oh!

622
00:44:15,295 --> 00:44:18,059
Mmm!

623
00:44:20,066 --> 00:44:23,502
That's Nietzsche. Beyond Good and Evil.

624
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:25,834
I found it in my Bartlett's.

625
00:44:25,906 --> 00:44:27,840
What's your Bartlett's?

626
00:44:27,907 --> 00:44:29,807
It's a quote book, Patrick.

627
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:31,775
It's a book of quotations.

628
00:44:31,844 --> 00:44:34,335
I think Howard will be in Bartlett's one day.

629
00:44:34,413 --> 00:44:36,347
Definitely. Howard is pure Bartlett's.

630
00:44:36,415 --> 00:44:38,781
God!

631
00:44:38,851 --> 00:44:41,411
Can you wake him up?

632
00:44:41,486 --> 00:44:43,420
You can't wake him up.

633
00:44:46,658 --> 00:44:48,649
Mmm.

634
00:44:52,996 --> 00:44:54,987
You don't tell me things, Joel.

635
00:44:56,533 --> 00:44:58,467
I'm an open book.

636
00:44:59,703 --> 00:45:01,637
I tell you everything.

637
00:45:01,705 --> 00:45:04,936
Every damn embarrassing thing.

638
00:45:07,543 --> 00:45:09,636
You don't trust me.

639
00:45:09,712 --> 00:45:13,239
Constantly talking isn't necessarily communicating.

640
00:45:15,685 --> 00:45:17,676
I don't do that.

641
00:45:20,155 --> 00:45:22,146
I want to know you.

642
00:45:23,325 --> 00:45:25,259
Hmm?

643
00:45:25,327 --> 00:45:28,353
I don't constantly talk. Jesus!

644
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:32,391
People have to share things, Joel.

645
00:45:32,466 --> 00:45:34,400
Mm-hmm.

646
00:45:34,468 --> 00:45:36,561
That's what intimacy is.

647
00:45:36,637 --> 00:45:39,572
I'm really pissed that you said that to me.

648
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,574
I'm sorry.

649
00:45:41,641 --> 00:45:44,633
It just... really just isn't that interesting.

650
00:45:45,845 --> 00:45:48,780
I wanna read some of those journals you're constantly scribbling in.

651
00:45:48,848 --> 00:45:52,011
What do you write in there if you don't have any thoughts or passions or...

652
00:45:52,085 --> 00:45:54,076
love?

653
00:46:00,892 --> 00:46:05,955
November 19, 2003.

654
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:08,692
Dinner at Kang's again.

655
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:14,037
Are we like those poor couples...

656
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:16,835
you feel sorry for in restaurants?

657
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:19,273
Are we the dining dead?

658
00:46:19,342 --> 00:46:24,041
I can't stand the idea of us being a couple people think that about.

659
00:46:28,018 --> 00:46:30,452
I like that.

660
00:46:31,787 --> 00:46:33,721
How's the chicken?

661
00:46:33,789 --> 00:46:35,780
Good.

662
00:46:37,226 --> 00:46:40,161
- More? - No. No. Thank you.

663
00:46:43,197 --> 00:46:45,631
She's gonna be drunk and stupid now.

664
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:48,134
Hey, would you do me a favor...

665
00:46:48,202 --> 00:46:51,171
and clean the goddamn hair off the soap when you're done in the shower?

666
00:46:51,239 --> 00:46:53,173
- Yeah. Oh. Yeah. - It's really...

667
00:46:53,241 --> 00:46:55,334
- Gross. - gross.

668
00:46:57,644 --> 00:47:00,135
- It's just... - Repulsive.

669
00:47:00,213 --> 00:47:01,874
It's repulsive.

670
00:47:07,653 --> 00:47:10,315
Patrick, can we get through this?

671
00:47:10,389 --> 00:47:12,152
Patrick.

672
00:47:12,224 --> 00:47:14,158
Hey, Tangerine.

673
00:47:14,226 --> 00:47:17,354
Oh, Patrick, it's you.

674
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:19,694
I'm so miserable right now.

675
00:47:19,765 --> 00:47:22,165
- Why? What's wrong? - I don't know.

676
00:47:22,233 --> 00:47:24,167
- Excuse me? - I'm so confused!

677
00:47:24,235 --> 00:47:26,169
Can I help you find something, sir?

678
00:47:26,237 --> 00:47:29,229
Confused? What are you confused about? Everything's fine.

679
00:47:30,241 --> 00:47:32,175
Baby, come here.

680
00:47:32,242 --> 00:47:34,233
Scared of what?

681
00:47:38,315 --> 00:47:41,341
- Do you love me? - Of course I do.

682
00:47:41,418 --> 00:47:43,352
Where's the self-help section?

683
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:45,888
Do you think I'm ugly?

684
00:47:45,405 --> 00:47:47,839
No! You're beautiful!

685
00:47:47,908 --> 00:47:50,172
- Maybe I should come over. - No, no.

686
00:47:50,243 --> 00:47:53,178
I don't know. I-I'm a mess, Patrick.

687
00:47:53,246 --> 00:47:55,942
Well, just let me come over. I'll cheer you up.

688
00:47:56,016 --> 00:47:57,881
Okay.

689
00:47:57,950 --> 00:48:01,147
Stan, can I leave for a while? My girlfriend's really upset.

690
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:03,415
We're right in the middle of erasing this poor man's...

691
00:48:03,489 --> 00:48:05,423
Let him go, Stan!

692
00:48:05,491 --> 00:48:08,426
Let him go. I'll help.

693
00:48:08,494 --> 00:48:10,428
- See? - How hard can it be?

694
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:14,192
- She hates me. She wants me to go. - Go.

695
00:48:14,265 --> 00:48:17,166
All right. I'll be right over, Tangerine.

696
00:48:17,235 --> 00:48:18,930
You like?

697
00:48:19,003 --> 00:48:22,063
Oh, man!

698
00:48:22,139 --> 00:48:24,107
I matched my sweatshirt exactly.

699
00:48:24,174 --> 00:48:26,108
- I like it. - You do?

700
00:48:26,176 --> 00:48:28,406
- You look like a tangerine. - Ohh!

701
00:48:28,478 --> 00:48:31,936
- "Clemen-teen" the tangerine. - Mmm! Juicy!

702
00:48:32,015 --> 00:48:34,506
- And seedless. - I like that.

703
00:48:35,952 --> 00:48:38,386
I like tangerines!

704
00:48:38,454 --> 00:48:40,615
Can you see me doing ducks?

705
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:43,591
- Tangerine. - Joel. Ducks. Quack-quack.

706
00:48:43,659 --> 00:48:46,594
- How does he know to call you that? - How did who know?

707
00:48:46,661 --> 00:48:49,425
- Oh, my God. Clem? - This is pretty cool.

708
00:48:49,497 --> 00:48:51,431
That's what they called themselves.

709
00:48:51,499 --> 00:48:53,933
The Clash... the only band that mattered.

710
00:48:54,002 --> 00:48:55,936
They called themselves that for a reason.

711
00:48:56,004 --> 00:48:59,371
- It's amazing, isn't it? - Like social justice... Yeah, it's totally incredible.

712
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,965
What Howard gives to the world.

713
00:49:02,977 --> 00:49:05,070
Yeah.

714
00:49:05,145 --> 00:49:07,579
To let people begin again.

715
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:11,584
It's beautiful.

716
00:49:11,651 --> 00:49:16,588
You look at a baby, and it's so pure and so free and so clean.

717
00:49:16,656 --> 00:49:20,092
And adults are, like, this mess of sadness...

718
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:22,957
and... phobias.

719
00:49:23,029 --> 00:49:26,089
Howard just makes it all go away.

720
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,964
Oh, my God.

721
00:49:39,744 --> 00:49:42,679
- Baby, what's going on? - I don't know. I don't know!

722
00:49:42,747 --> 00:49:45,147
I'm lost, I'm scared,

723
00:49:45,216 --> 00:49:47,150
I feel like I'm disappearing.

724
00:49:47,218 --> 00:49:50,153
- Disappearing? - My skin's coming off! I'm getting old!

725
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:53,155
- Nothing makes any sense to me! - You're not getting old.

726
00:49:53,223 --> 00:49:56,454
- Nothing makes any sense. - Ohh, Tangerine.

727
00:49:56,526 --> 00:49:58,824
Nothing makes any sense.

728
00:49:58,895 --> 00:50:02,524
- Nothing makes any sense, Patrick. - It's okay. It's okay.

729
00:50:02,598 --> 00:50:06,625
Hey, let's go out dancing. Yeah? You wanna go out to Montauk with me?

730
00:50:06,702 --> 00:50:08,636
- Montauk? - Yeah.

731
00:50:08,704 --> 00:50:12,401
- No! Come up to Boston with me. - Sure. Yeah. We can go next weekend.

732
00:50:12,474 --> 00:50:14,114
No, no. Now. Now.

733
00:50:14,213 --> 00:50:15,713
Yeah. I have to go now.

734
00:50:15,777 --> 00:50:18,211
I have to see the frozen Charles now.

735
00:50:21,783 --> 00:50:24,217
Hi, it's Joel.

736
00:50:24,285 --> 00:50:29,484
Um, leave a message after the beep and I'll get back to you.

737
00:50:31,558 --> 00:50:33,992
Pick up! Pick up, man!

738
00:50:34,061 --> 00:50:36,859
W-W-W-W-Whoa. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

739
00:50:38,931 --> 00:50:41,365
Hello? Yeah, what's up?

740
00:50:41,434 --> 00:50:44,528
I got into a little situation with the old lady.

741
00:50:44,603 --> 00:50:47,367
Can you handle things tonight alone? I'm really sorry, man.

742
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,375
Don't worry about it. I got it under control, man.

743
00:50:50,442 --> 00:50:54,003
- He's pretty much on autopilot right now anyway. - Thanks, Stan. I owe you big-time.

744
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:56,809
Dude, I gotta go. I gotta go.

745
00:50:58,683 --> 00:51:00,674
Charles.

746
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:04,811
Come on, Charles.

747
00:51:09,426 --> 00:51:13,760
"Look! You and me on the Charles River. I could die right now, Clem.

748
00:51:13,831 --> 00:51:18,029
I'm just happy. I've never felt that before. I'm just exactly where I want..."

749
00:51:20,002 --> 00:51:22,664
- I'm so excited. Yea. - I'm excited too!

750
00:51:22,739 --> 00:51:26,607
- Cool. - Oh, uh, I, uh...

751
00:51:26,676 --> 00:51:29,543
I got you this...

752
00:51:29,611 --> 00:51:32,671
- What? - thing, um...

753
00:51:32,748 --> 00:51:34,682
Happy early Valentine's Day.

754
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:36,741
Oh!

755
00:51:38,186 --> 00:51:40,211
Wow. What is it?

756
00:51:40,287 --> 00:51:42,778
Uh, I don't know. Open it up.

757
00:51:48,329 --> 00:51:50,263
Oh.

758
00:51:50,331 --> 00:51:52,265
It... It's gorgeous!

759
00:51:52,332 --> 00:51:55,267
- You like it? - Yeah. It's just my taste. Really.

760
00:51:55,335 --> 00:51:59,704
I've never gone out with a guy who bought me a piece of jewelry I liked.

761
00:51:59,773 --> 00:52:01,764
Thank you.

762
00:52:08,781 --> 00:52:10,715
- Let's go. - Okay.

763
00:52:11,150 --> 00:52:14,051
- Joely? - Yeah, Tangerine?

764
00:52:15,687 --> 00:52:18,212
Am I ugly?

765
00:52:18,289 --> 00:52:21,725
When I was a kid, I thought I was.

766
00:52:21,793 --> 00:52:25,889
Can't believe I'm crying already.

767
00:52:25,963 --> 00:52:31,799
Sometimes I think people don't understand how lonely it is to be a kid.

768
00:52:31,868 --> 00:52:34,894
Like you don't matter.

769
00:52:34,971 --> 00:52:38,304
So, I'm eight...

770
00:52:38,375 --> 00:52:40,639
and I have these toys,

771
00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:42,644
these dolls.

772
00:52:42,711 --> 00:52:47,444
My favorite is this ugly girl doll who I call Clementine.

773
00:52:47,516 --> 00:52:49,450
And I keep yelling at her:

774
00:52:49,518 --> 00:52:53,852
"You can't be ugly! Be pretty!"

775
00:52:53,922 --> 00:52:55,947
It's weird.

776
00:52:56,024 --> 00:52:59,050
Like if I can transform her,

777
00:52:59,127 --> 00:53:01,755
I would magically change too.

778
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,434
You're pretty.

779
00:53:08,502 --> 00:53:11,665
Joely, don't ever leave me.

780
00:53:11,738 --> 00:53:15,765
Pretty. Pretty. Pretty. Pretty.

781
00:53:15,843 --> 00:53:19,779
Mierzwiak, please let me keep this memory.

782
00:53:19,846 --> 00:53:21,780
Just this one.

783
00:53:21,848 --> 00:53:24,783
I don't wanna hold your hand. Come on.

784
00:53:24,851 --> 00:53:26,546
- Whoo! - Whoa!

785
00:53:26,619 --> 00:53:28,553
Stop it!

786
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:34,652
I could die right now, Clem.

787
00:53:35,894 --> 00:53:37,885
I'm just...

788
00:53:39,698 --> 00:53:41,859
happy.

789
00:53:43,767 --> 00:53:46,429
I've never felt that before.

790
00:53:47,571 --> 00:53:49,505
Mmm.

791
00:53:49,573 --> 00:53:51,564
I'm just exactly...

792
00:53:53,811 --> 00:53:55,802
where I wanna be.

793
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,871
Clem?

794
00:54:05,088 --> 00:54:07,579
I wanna call it off.

795
00:54:07,656 --> 00:54:09,647
I'll give you a sign.

796
00:54:14,496 --> 00:54:16,846
I wanna call it off!

797
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:21,135
Can you hear me? I don't want this anymore!

798
00:54:21,202 --> 00:54:23,568
I wanna call it off!

799
00:54:29,810 --> 00:54:33,576
Is anybody there?

800
00:54:39,986 --> 00:54:42,477
- Clementine? - Joel?

801
00:54:42,555 --> 00:54:44,785
- Clement... - Joely?

802
00:54:44,857 --> 00:54:46,950
- Clem! - Joel?

803
00:54:47,026 --> 00:54:49,824
Clem!

804
00:54:49,895 --> 00:54:52,125
- What? - We gotta go. We gotta go.

805
00:54:52,197 --> 00:54:54,631
- What? Where? - I have an idea of how to stop this.

806
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:57,032
Stop what?

807
00:54:57,101 --> 00:54:59,035
- Joely. - Come on, Clem.

808
00:54:59,103 --> 00:55:02,402
- Smell my armpit! Smell my armpit! - No!

809
00:55:02,473 --> 00:55:05,033
- Don't tickle me! Don't make me smell you. - Smell my pits!

810
00:55:05,109 --> 00:55:07,043
- No. - Good.

811
00:55:07,111 --> 00:55:09,477
Concentrate, Clem.

812
00:55:09,546 --> 00:55:12,037
We gotta get back to the office.

813
00:55:12,115 --> 00:55:14,640
There was a tape recorder. No, not the picture.

814
00:55:14,718 --> 00:55:16,743
Not the picture.

815
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:19,880
Where is it? Back here. Come on!

816
00:55:19,957 --> 00:55:22,619
Oh, look at me. Hey, I look good there.

817
00:55:22,692 --> 00:55:26,389
Look, our files are confidential, Mr. Barish,

818
00:55:26,462 --> 00:55:28,396
so I can't show you evidence.

819
00:55:28,464 --> 00:55:31,865
Suffice it to say that Miss, uh... Miss Kruczynski...

820
00:55:31,934 --> 00:55:35,802
was not happy and she wanted to move on.

821
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:40,398
- Good. Now, tell me about Clementine. - Just tell me everything you remember.

822
00:55:40,475 --> 00:55:43,342
- That's what he said. Then... - What did we see that day?

823
00:55:43,411 --> 00:55:45,345
- No, wait. - Oh, look! Hey!

824
00:55:45,413 --> 00:55:47,904
- Shit! - We're going to see my grandma.

825
00:55:47,982 --> 00:55:50,678
- Joel, why... - No, I don't want to... - Joel, please! - We're not going on a train.

826
00:55:50,751 --> 00:55:53,515
- Don't make me run anymore. - Come on!

827
00:55:53,587 --> 00:55:55,919
Mierzwiak!

828
00:55:55,990 --> 00:55:58,959
- Do we always have to run? - Mierzwiak!

829
00:56:08,334 --> 00:56:10,268
Please.

830
00:56:10,336 --> 00:56:13,703
So, why don't we begin by you telling me...

831
00:56:13,772 --> 00:56:15,865
everything you can remember.

832
00:56:15,941 --> 00:56:18,432
Mierzwiak! Wake me up!

833
00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:21,536
Oh, I-I'm sorry, Mr. Barish.

834
00:56:21,613 --> 00:56:24,605
I thought you understood what was going on here.

835
00:56:24,682 --> 00:56:27,845
I don't know. You're erasing her from me.

836
00:56:27,918 --> 00:56:30,853
You're erasing me from her...

837
00:56:33,391 --> 00:56:35,325
I don't know.

838
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:39,055
You've got this thing. I'm in my bed. I know it.

839
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:41,063
I'm in my brain.

840
00:56:41,131 --> 00:56:44,032
I'm part of your imagination too, Joel.

841
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,728
How can I help you from there?

842
00:56:46,803 --> 00:56:50,295
Uh, I'm inside your head too. I'm you.

843
00:56:50,372 --> 00:56:54,001
Sorry.

844
00:56:54,076 --> 00:56:56,135
Look. Who's that?

845
00:56:56,211 --> 00:56:58,270
Oh, he-he works for us.

846
00:56:58,347 --> 00:57:03,011
That's, uh, Pa-a-a-a-atrick,

847
00:57:03,084 --> 00:57:05,678
baby boy.

848
00:57:05,753 --> 00:57:08,244
He's stealing my identity.

849
00:57:08,322 --> 00:57:10,722
He stole my stuff.

850
00:57:10,792 --> 00:57:14,489
He's, uh, seducing my girlfriend with my words and my things.

851
00:57:14,561 --> 00:57:17,758
He stole her underwear. Oh, Jesus Christ!

852
00:57:17,831 --> 00:57:19,765
He stole her underwear.

853
00:57:19,833 --> 00:57:23,234
I could die right now, Clem.

854
00:57:23,303 --> 00:57:25,771
I'm just happy.

855
00:57:25,838 --> 00:57:30,434
I've never felt that before. I'm just exactly where I want to be.

856
00:57:31,977 --> 00:57:33,968
I want to go home.

857
00:57:35,081 --> 00:57:37,015
Hey. What?

858
00:57:39,451 --> 00:57:43,080
Clem!

859
00:57:43,154 --> 00:57:45,145
Wait. Clem!

860
00:57:46,224 --> 00:57:48,419
Clem?

861
00:57:48,493 --> 00:57:50,961
They're erasing you.

862
00:57:51,028 --> 00:57:52,962
I'm here!

863
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:55,692
Clem, focus. I hired them, okay?

864
00:57:55,766 --> 00:57:57,700
I'm so stupid.

865
00:57:57,768 --> 00:58:00,794
Sweetie, calm down. Enjoy the scenery.

866
00:58:00,871 --> 00:58:04,204
I need it to stop before I wake up and I don't know you anymore.

867
00:58:05,842 --> 00:58:10,074
Okay, well, you know, just tell them to cancel it then.

868
00:58:10,146 --> 00:58:13,377
What the hell are you talking about? I can't just cancel it. I'm asleep.

869
00:58:13,449 --> 00:58:15,212
Wake yourself up!

870
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:18,047
Okay. You want me to wake up? Okay. Great. All right.

871
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:21,021
- Okay, here we go. This make you happy if I try? - Yeah.

872
00:58:21,089 --> 00:58:24,115
I'll try really hard. Here we go. That was a great idea.

873
00:58:24,192 --> 00:58:26,319
Yeah. Okay.

874
00:58:26,393 --> 00:58:29,624
Boy, that's working like gangbusters.

875
00:58:29,697 --> 00:58:32,222
- Don't! That tickles me! - Oh, my goodness.

876
00:58:32,299 --> 00:58:34,733
Oh, my God. What is that? Jesus Christ! What the...

877
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:36,736
It's a birthmark!

878
00:58:40,039 --> 00:58:43,304
It did work, for a second,

879
00:58:43,376 --> 00:58:45,901
- but I couldn't... I couldn't move. - See?

880
00:58:45,979 --> 00:58:50,643
Oh, well, isn't that just another one of Joel's self-fulfilling prophecies?

881
00:58:50,717 --> 00:58:53,049
It's more important to prove me wrong than to actually...

882
00:58:53,118 --> 00:58:56,281
Look, I don't want to discuss this right now, okay?

883
00:58:56,355 --> 00:58:59,688
Fine.

884
00:58:59,758 --> 00:59:02,750
Then what? I'm listening.

885
00:59:02,828 --> 00:59:05,524
I don't know. You erased me.

886
00:59:05,596 --> 00:59:08,258
That's why I'm here. That's why I'm doing this in the first place.

887
00:59:08,332 --> 00:59:10,266
- I'm sorry. - You... You!

888
00:59:10,334 --> 00:59:12,768
You know me. I'm impulsive.

889
00:59:16,072 --> 00:59:18,165
That's what I love about you.

890
00:59:21,945 --> 00:59:23,469
Joel?

891
00:59:23,547 --> 00:59:26,516
- Mm-hmm? - I have another idea for this problem.

892
00:59:26,583 --> 00:59:28,847
This is a memory of me,

893
00:59:28,918 --> 00:59:33,617
the way you wanted to have sex on the couch after you looked down at my crotch.

894
00:59:33,689 --> 00:59:36,624
- What? - Joel, the eraser guys are coming here,

895
00:59:36,692 --> 00:59:39,684
so what if you take me somewhere else,

896
00:59:39,762 --> 00:59:41,923
somewhere where I don't belong,

897
00:59:41,996 --> 00:59:44,556
and we hide there till morning?

898
00:59:48,970 --> 00:59:52,371
Oh, man. I can't remember anything without you.

899
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:55,603
Tsk, that's very sweet, but try, okay?

900
00:59:55,676 --> 00:59:57,610
Okay.

901
00:59:57,266 --> 01:00:02,516
Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream

902
01:00:02,746 --> 01:00:04,916
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily

903
01:00:05,016 --> 01:00:09,016
Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream

904
01:00:09,612 --> 01:00:11,365
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily

905
01:00:11,461 --> 01:00:13,461
Life is but a dream

906
01:00:21,567 --> 01:00:23,626
It's working!

907
01:00:23,702 --> 01:00:27,263
I'm a genius!

908
01:00:47,757 --> 01:00:51,954
Joel?

909
01:00:53,697 --> 01:00:55,858
Where'd you go?

910
01:00:55,931 --> 01:00:57,728
I'm supposed to come too!

911
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:01,327
Listen, I'm just gonna go get a salad bowl. Can you stir the soup and keep an eye on Joel?

912
01:01:01,403 --> 01:01:03,337
Sure. He just likes to be near me.

913
01:01:03,405 --> 01:01:05,373
- Absolutely! - Clem?

914
01:01:05,441 --> 01:01:06,941
It worked.

915
01:01:07,012 --> 01:01:09,512
My God, look at this! Wow!

916
01:01:09,677 --> 01:01:13,841
It worked! Look! Look at this dress, man!

917
01:01:13,915 --> 01:01:18,477
Oh, my God! Look at it! I wish I could take it with me.

918
01:01:18,953 --> 01:01:20,500
Who am I?

919
01:01:20,521 --> 01:01:22,821
- Mrs. Hamlyn. - Right. Mrs. Hamlyn.

920
01:01:22,990 --> 01:01:25,550
I must be about four. Oh, my gosh.

921
01:01:25,626 --> 01:01:28,925
Found the salad bowl, so I'm serving salad and string beans.

922
01:01:28,996 --> 01:01:31,487
Is he okay under there? Peanut, are you all right?

923
01:01:31,065 --> 01:01:34,762
God, honestly, I feel like I could clean up all day.

924
01:01:34,834 --> 01:01:37,894
- Listen, would you hate me if I asked you to clean some string beans? - No, not at all.

925
01:01:37,971 --> 01:01:40,496
Oh, my God. I love this kitchen.

926
01:01:40,573 --> 01:01:43,565
- Thank you so much. - She's not looking at me.

927
01:01:43,643 --> 01:01:46,771
She's busy. She's not looking at me.

928
01:01:46,845 --> 01:01:50,178
No one ever looks at me. I want my mommy.

929
01:01:50,249 --> 01:01:51,749
Oh, baby Joel.

930
01:01:51,824 --> 01:01:53,257
Hey, Joely! Joely!

931
01:01:53,318 --> 01:01:55,843
- Is every little peanut under there okay? - Mm-hmm! He's fine.

932
01:01:55,921 --> 01:01:58,253
Do you have something to drink?

933
01:01:58,322 --> 01:02:00,984
Would you drink a cocktail at this hour? I mean, I know it's not 5:00.

934
01:02:01,058 --> 01:02:03,549
- I would die for a vodka. - Oh, hang on. Let me check if I have that.

935
01:02:03,628 --> 01:02:06,358
Okay! I'm just gonna wait right here. Joel! Hey, no, sweetie.

936
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:08,365
Uh, Joely.

937
01:02:08,432 --> 01:02:12,061
- Your mother wants me to mind you. Get back under the table. - Ice cream.

938
01:02:12,135 --> 01:02:16,504
- Ice cream. - No, not until after, you know, you've had your dinner.

939
01:02:16,573 --> 01:02:18,598
Come on, Joel!

940
01:02:18,675 --> 01:02:20,609
Joel, grow up!

941
01:02:20,677 --> 01:02:23,043
Don't leave me, Clem. Oh, my God, Clem.

942
01:02:23,112 --> 01:02:25,546
- This is sort of warped. - I'm scared.

943
01:02:25,614 --> 01:02:28,913
- I want my mommy! - Don't cry, baby Joel.

944
01:02:28,954 --> 01:02:33,254
Baby Joel, it's okay. Joel. Joely. Joel!

945
01:02:33,354 --> 01:02:36,152
Stop it! Look, I think it's working. Look, we're hidden, Joel. Look!

946
01:02:36,224 --> 01:02:39,057
Hey, honey, look.

947
01:02:39,127 --> 01:02:41,118
Wait there.

948
01:02:44,499 --> 01:02:47,229
My crotch is still here, just as you remembered it.

949
01:02:47,301 --> 01:02:49,235
Yuck.

950
01:02:51,905 --> 01:02:55,397
It stopped.

951
01:02:55,476 --> 01:02:59,207
- What? - It stopped erasing.

952
01:02:59,278 --> 01:03:01,712
Oh, shit.

953
01:03:01,781 --> 01:03:03,772
This is terrible.

954
01:03:05,318 --> 01:03:07,616
He's off the map. He's off the map.

955
01:03:07,687 --> 01:03:11,248
- Where? - I don't know where! What do you mean? I don't know where!

956
01:03:11,323 --> 01:03:15,419
This is bad. This is very, very bad news. Where are my glasses?

957
01:03:15,494 --> 01:03:18,054
Okay. Crap.

958
01:03:18,129 --> 01:03:20,893
Okay. What do we do? What do I do?

959
01:03:20,966 --> 01:03:23,526
- What shall we do? - I don't know what to do.

960
01:03:23,601 --> 01:03:25,831
- What shall we do? - Crap. Crap. I don't know!

961
01:03:25,903 --> 01:03:28,531
- I just said that I don't know what to do. - I'm sorry. What do we do?

962
01:03:28,606 --> 01:03:32,201
I don't know. Now, look, you're freaking me out. Mellow out.

963
01:03:32,276 --> 01:03:36,110
Well, you have to do something. He could wake up all half-baked.

964
01:03:36,179 --> 01:03:39,205
Quiet. You're freaking me out. Shh. Shh.

965
01:03:39,282 --> 01:03:42,274
All gooey and... and half-baked. Hmm, that sounds so good.

966
01:03:42,352 --> 01:03:44,286
- Oh, shit! - I'm hungry.

967
01:03:44,354 --> 01:03:46,288
- Oh, shit. - Oh! Oh!

968
01:03:46,356 --> 01:03:48,824
What? Oh! What, what? What?

969
01:03:48,891 --> 01:03:51,826
- We should call Howard. - No way. No, sir, man.

970
01:03:51,894 --> 01:03:54,055
This is my... I can handle this.

971
01:03:54,129 --> 01:03:56,427
- I can't call Howard. - He's an unbaked cookie.

972
01:03:56,498 --> 01:03:59,194
He's... There's no time to fuck around.

973
01:03:59,268 --> 01:04:01,759
I got this under control. What are you talking about?

974
01:04:01,836 --> 01:04:04,703
- Stop fucking around! - Okay, I'll call Howard.

975
01:04:12,445 --> 01:04:15,812
- Hello. - Hello, Howard? Hey, it's Stan.

976
01:04:15,882 --> 01:04:19,716
Um, I'm working on this guy down here, and we seem to have lost him for a moment,

977
01:04:19,786 --> 01:04:22,550
and, uh, I can't... I can't bring him back up.

978
01:04:22,622 --> 01:04:26,058
Okay, uh, tell me what happened before he disappeared.

979
01:04:26,125 --> 01:04:29,526
Well, I wasn't sure, really, 'cause I was away from the monitor for a minute...

980
01:04:29,595 --> 01:04:32,291
and I had it on autopilot because I had to, uh...

981
01:04:32,364 --> 01:04:34,298
I had to pee.

982
01:04:34,366 --> 01:04:38,063
- Where's Patrick? - Patrick? Patrick had to go home sick.

983
01:04:38,136 --> 01:04:40,070
Ah, geez.

984
01:04:40,138 --> 01:04:42,902
- Okay, what's the address? - I know. I'm so sorry.

985
01:04:42,974 --> 01:04:46,671
- That's okay. Come on. - I'm at 159 South Village.

986
01:04:46,744 --> 01:04:49,907
- Yeah. - Apartment 1E. Rockville Center.

987
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:52,642
- Mary? - Yeah? - He's coming right now.

988
01:04:52,716 --> 01:04:54,650
I'm staying.

989
01:04:54,718 --> 01:04:57,084
- Get your stuff, Mary. - I'm staying.

990
01:04:57,154 --> 01:04:59,645
- I think you should go. - Hell, no.

991
01:04:59,723 --> 01:05:03,318
Mary... Shit.

992
01:05:03,392 --> 01:05:07,385
- I am so stoned. - Please, Mary.

993
01:05:07,463 --> 01:05:09,829
- You have to go. - Stop being stoned, Mary.

994
01:05:09,899 --> 01:05:12,697
I don't want him to see me stoned.

995
01:05:12,768 --> 01:05:16,932
- Mary, you have no idea how much trouble we're gonna get into if Howard comes... - I look like shit!

996
01:05:17,005 --> 01:05:19,005
Joely, stop it! Joel! Look!

997
01:05:19,065 --> 01:05:20,365
Hey, Joel!

998
01:05:26,113 --> 01:05:28,104
- Joel! - I want her to pick me up.

999
01:05:28,182 --> 01:05:31,709
- It's weird how strong that desire is. - Joel, look at me! Look.

1000
01:05:31,785 --> 01:05:34,117
You'll remember me in the morning,

1001
01:05:34,188 --> 01:05:37,351
and you'll come to me, and you'll tell me about us, and we'll start over.

1002
01:05:37,424 --> 01:05:39,790
Pat? I just... Pat?

1003
01:05:39,859 --> 01:05:42,020
I thought we could have a little cocktail.

1004
01:05:42,095 --> 01:05:44,563
That Patrick guy... he's copying me.

1005
01:05:44,631 --> 01:05:46,622
What Patrick guy?

1006
01:05:46,699 --> 01:05:48,462
- That guy! - What?

1007
01:05:48,534 --> 01:05:50,399
He's here in my apartment.

1008
01:05:50,470 --> 01:05:52,404
He's one of those eraser guys.

1009
01:05:52,471 --> 01:05:56,805
He fell for you when they were doing you, and now he's introduced himself like he doesn't even know you,

1010
01:05:56,875 --> 01:05:59,207
and you guys are dating.

1011
01:05:59,277 --> 01:06:02,508
Really? Is he cute?

1012
01:06:04,915 --> 01:06:07,315
Clem, there's nothing wrong with you.

1013
01:06:07,385 --> 01:06:09,979
You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.

1014
01:06:10,054 --> 01:06:12,989
You... You're kind,

1015
01:06:13,057 --> 01:06:15,287
beautiful...

1016
01:06:15,358 --> 01:06:17,588
and smart and funny...

1017
01:06:17,661 --> 01:06:19,891
and... nice.

1018
01:06:19,963 --> 01:06:22,193
What?

1019
01:06:23,433 --> 01:06:25,867
Okay. All right.

1020
01:06:27,404 --> 01:06:29,702
Okay. Oh!

1021
01:06:29,772 --> 01:06:32,070
- Move, move, move! - Careful, careful. - Come on. Let's go.

1022
01:06:32,141 --> 01:06:33,938
Fine.

1023
01:06:34,009 --> 01:06:37,410
Oh, my God. I'm still stoned.

1024
01:06:37,479 --> 01:06:39,879
Those eyedrops you gave me didn't do shit.

1025
01:06:44,619 --> 01:06:46,553
Be cool. Cool.

1026
01:06:51,125 --> 01:06:53,423
- Hello, Mary. What are you doing here? - Oh, hi, Howard.

1027
01:06:53,493 --> 01:06:55,427
She was just here to help out.

1028
01:06:55,495 --> 01:06:58,658
I wanted to understand as much as I could about the procedure as possible.

1029
01:06:58,732 --> 01:07:02,429
I think it's important for my job to understand the inner workings...

1030
01:07:02,502 --> 01:07:04,697
of the work that we do.

1031
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:07,466
Well, not that I do, but the work that is done...

1032
01:07:07,540 --> 01:07:11,237
by people... where I also work, the work of my colleagues.

1033
01:07:11,310 --> 01:07:14,336
All right, well, let's see if we can, uh,

1034
01:07:14,413 --> 01:07:16,973
get to the bottom of this, shall we?

1035
01:07:17,048 --> 01:07:19,039
Uh, yeah. Um...

1036
01:07:21,786 --> 01:07:24,254
- Well, that's odd. - I already tried that.

1037
01:07:24,322 --> 01:07:28,088
- Did you try going through the C-gate? - Yeah, of course.

1038
01:07:28,159 --> 01:07:29,956
I mean... yes.

1039
01:07:30,027 --> 01:07:32,257
Yeah.

1040
01:07:34,465 --> 01:07:36,399
All right.

1041
01:07:37,935 --> 01:07:39,869
- You want to get linked up? - Yeah.

1042
01:07:39,937 --> 01:07:42,235
All right.

1043
01:07:42,305 --> 01:07:44,933
I already... I ran the utility programs,

1044
01:07:45,007 --> 01:07:46,998
and I had nothing there,

1045
01:07:47,076 --> 01:07:50,068
so I checked all the memories against the printed logs.

1046
01:07:50,146 --> 01:07:52,137
- Here, Howard. - Okay.

1047
01:07:52,215 --> 01:07:54,615
- I got you a chair. - Oh, thank you. - There you go.

1048
01:07:54,683 --> 01:07:57,243
You're welcome.

1049
01:07:57,319 --> 01:08:00,914
All right, I'm gonna... I'm gonna go through the entire memory,

1050
01:08:00,989 --> 01:08:02,980
see if something comes up.

1051
01:08:09,730 --> 01:08:12,221
I love being bathed in the sink.

1052
01:08:12,299 --> 01:08:14,790
Such a feeling of security.

1053
01:08:14,869 --> 01:08:18,100
- I've never seen you happier, baby Joel. - Hmm!

1054
01:08:18,172 --> 01:08:20,106
There it is.

1055
01:08:20,173 --> 01:08:24,507
I don't understand why it's off the map like that.

1056
01:08:24,577 --> 01:08:26,636
What the heck was he doing there?

1057
01:08:36,221 --> 01:08:38,212
His eyes are open.

1058
01:08:40,092 --> 01:08:43,687
- Has this happened before with him? - No.

1059
01:08:43,761 --> 01:08:47,322
Oh, this is... this is not good. No.

1060
01:08:47,398 --> 01:08:49,628
I'm gonna have to...

1061
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:51,634
I'm gonna have to give him this.

1062
01:09:16,058 --> 01:09:18,686
Can't you see I love you, Antoine?

1063
01:09:18,761 --> 01:09:21,924
Okay, we're back in.

1064
01:09:21,996 --> 01:09:26,228
Wow. That was beautiful to watch, Howard.

1065
01:09:26,301 --> 01:09:30,328
Like a surgeon or a concert pianist or something.

1066
01:09:30,405 --> 01:09:32,339
Thank you, Mary.

1067
01:09:32,407 --> 01:09:36,503
Um, Howard, you should get some sleep. I-I think I'll be fine now.

1068
01:09:36,577 --> 01:09:41,139
Why can't you see I love you, Antoine?

1069
01:09:41,215 --> 01:09:43,206
Hmm. Lucky me.

1070
01:09:43,283 --> 01:09:47,686
Lay one on me.

1071
01:09:48,821 --> 01:09:50,948
Don't call me Antoine.

1072
01:09:51,023 --> 01:09:53,423
- My name is Wally. - Yes, I know,

1073
01:09:53,492 --> 01:09:56,052
but how can a woman love a man with a name like Wally?

1074
01:09:56,128 --> 01:09:58,528
Oh! Oh! What was that?

1075
01:09:58,597 --> 01:10:01,293
- Hey. - My God, there's people coming out of your butt.

1076
01:10:01,366 --> 01:10:03,857
There is?

1077
01:10:05,003 --> 01:10:07,471
- Got it. - Tangerine!

1078
01:10:07,539 --> 01:10:10,565
- What, Joel... What are you doing? - We gotta go.

1079
01:10:10,641 --> 01:10:13,303
Go on. Please, please, go. Please go!

1080
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:18,045
You can run, but you can't hide.

1081
01:10:18,115 --> 01:10:19,912
Clem, come on!

1082
01:10:20,951 --> 01:10:22,885
There I am.

1083
01:10:22,952 --> 01:10:24,886
That truck.

1084
01:10:24,954 --> 01:10:27,855
Doc? Please.

1085
01:10:27,924 --> 01:10:32,054
All right, let's begin by you telling me...

1086
01:10:32,128 --> 01:10:34,892
everything you remember...

1087
01:10:34,963 --> 01:10:38,865
That's strange. He's in a memory that we've already erased.

1088
01:10:38,934 --> 01:10:42,995
Oh, well, at least we know where he is. He's back on track, right?

1089
01:10:43,071 --> 01:10:45,005
Come on, Clem.

1090
01:10:44,573 --> 01:10:47,599
He seems to have developed some sort of resistance to the procedure.

1091
01:10:47,675 --> 01:10:50,269
- I don't want to run anymore. - Shit.

1092
01:10:52,313 --> 01:10:55,874
- Come on, come on. - Hide me somewhere deeper, somewhere really buried.

1093
01:10:55,950 --> 01:10:58,680
- Where? - Hide me in your humiliation.

1094
01:10:59,853 --> 01:11:02,447
- Humiliation. - Come on, you big baby!

1095
01:11:02,523 --> 01:11:04,457
I'm sorry, okay?

1096
01:11:07,995 --> 01:11:10,828
Let me drive you home.

1097
01:11:10,898 --> 01:11:13,332
No!

1098
01:11:13,399 --> 01:11:16,857
- Bye, Howard. - No, wait. Howard.

1099
01:11:16,936 --> 01:11:19,200
He's disappeared again.

1100
01:11:19,272 --> 01:11:23,470
- Oh, dear. - I'm so sorry, Howard.

1101
01:11:23,543 --> 01:11:28,239
Humiliation.

1102
01:11:28,313 --> 01:11:31,305
- Hu-mi-lia... - Joel.

1103
01:11:31,383 --> 01:11:33,544
I don't like it either.

1104
01:11:33,618 --> 01:11:36,143
I'm just trying to find horrible secret places to...

1105
01:11:36,220 --> 01:11:39,189
Joel, honey, I have a surprise... I just... Oh, um...

1106
01:11:39,256 --> 01:11:42,089
Uh, you know what, honey? I'm just gonna ask you in the morning.

1107
01:11:42,159 --> 01:11:44,992
Good night, sweetheart.

1108
01:11:45,062 --> 01:11:47,394
No.

1109
01:11:47,465 --> 01:11:50,457
- I'm sorry, Joel. Joely. - Shut up.

1110
01:11:51,701 --> 01:11:54,568
Look! Joel!

1111
01:11:54,637 --> 01:11:56,571
- Joel, look! - What?

1112
01:11:56,639 --> 01:11:58,573
Look where we are!

1113
01:11:58,641 --> 01:12:01,075
Whoo!

1114
01:12:01,143 --> 01:12:03,577
Clem, this isn't good.

1115
01:12:03,645 --> 01:12:07,513
Then hide me somewhere... somewhere really buried.

1116
01:12:10,285 --> 01:12:13,015
- Hit it! Hit it! - I can't! I gotta go home.

1117
01:12:13,088 --> 01:12:15,488
I'll do it later!

1118
01:12:18,659 --> 01:12:22,151
Come on, you big sissy!

1119
01:12:30,437 --> 01:12:32,701
Ooh!

1120
01:12:32,772 --> 01:12:35,866
Ooh, he has a girlfriend!

1121
01:12:35,942 --> 01:12:38,604
- Wait. What am I doing? - And he loves her! - You know something, Freddy?

1122
01:12:38,677 --> 01:12:40,872
You don't scare me anymore. Ow! Ow!

1123
01:12:40,946 --> 01:12:42,937
Joel!

1124
01:12:43,015 --> 01:12:45,848
- Joely, get up. Come on, it's not worth it. - Hit him! Hit him!

1125
01:12:45,918 --> 01:12:50,480
They're not worth it, Joel! Tra-la-la-la-la! He's not listening!

1126
01:12:50,555 --> 01:12:52,614
- Come on, Joel. - Stupid!

1127
01:12:58,763 --> 01:13:02,597
- I'm so ashamed. - It's okay.

1128
01:13:02,666 --> 01:13:04,930
- You were a little kid. - Yeah?

1129
01:13:05,002 --> 01:13:07,630
- Come on. - That's where I live... lived.

1130
01:13:07,704 --> 01:13:09,968
I wish I knew you when I was a kid.

1131
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:13,737
Do you like my pink hat? Here, look, feel better. You can really kill me this time.

1132
01:13:13,810 --> 01:13:16,438
- It's my turn. Go. One, two, three. - I can? You're really gonna die though.

1133
01:13:16,512 --> 01:13:18,742
- Okay. - One, two, three.

1134
01:13:18,814 --> 01:13:21,305
You're dead.

1135
01:13:21,384 --> 01:13:24,649
Oh, my mom. It's... It's okay. We're playing.

1136
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:27,416
- Hi, Joel's mom. He's killing me. - It's not real.

1137
01:13:27,489 --> 01:13:29,719
Okay, are you dead yet?

1138
01:13:29,791 --> 01:13:31,918
You're dead!

1139
01:13:31,993 --> 01:13:33,927
Uh, I think I got the hang of this.

1140
01:13:33,995 --> 01:13:37,226
I still don't understand it, but I'm finding him quickly enough.

1141
01:13:51,278 --> 01:13:54,611
Clem!

1142
01:13:55,615 --> 01:13:57,913
Clem!

1143
01:14:12,898 --> 01:14:14,832
Jo... Joely?

1144
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:17,027
Are you okay, Joel?

1145
01:14:17,101 --> 01:14:19,365
Joel? Joel?

1146
01:14:19,437 --> 01:14:22,304
Oh, my God. That was terrible.

1147
01:14:22,373 --> 01:14:24,307
- Okay, okay. - That was like three seconds.

1148
01:14:24,375 --> 01:14:28,277
- All right. Let me do it one more time. - One more, then I get to go.

1149
01:14:28,346 --> 01:14:31,281
Okay.

1150
01:14:39,022 --> 01:14:41,183
- Whoo-hoo-hoo! - Whoo!

1151
01:14:41,256 --> 01:14:43,588
- Look at this. - This is so cool!

1152
01:14:43,659 --> 01:14:45,820
Cool. Look out! Look out!

1153
01:14:46,929 --> 01:14:48,863
Ah!

1154
01:14:48,931 --> 01:14:50,922
- Shit! - It's fluff.

1155
01:14:52,501 --> 01:14:54,492
Our house!

1156
01:14:55,803 --> 01:14:57,998
- Come on. Whoo-hoo! - Come on.

1157
01:14:58,072 --> 01:15:00,006
Come on. We gotta go!

1158
01:15:00,074 --> 01:15:02,668
Whoo!

1159
01:15:02,744 --> 01:15:04,735
Come on!

1160
01:15:05,813 --> 01:15:07,713
We gotta go. Clem?

1161
01:15:07,781 --> 01:15:10,682
We gotta go.

1162
01:15:10,751 --> 01:15:12,651
Aah! Come on!

1163
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:14,914
- No! - This is a really bad time for this!

1164
01:15:14,988 --> 01:15:17,923
Get off me! Oh, God!

1165
01:15:17,991 --> 01:15:20,926
- I don't even know where we're going. - It's gonna be fun. Come on.

1166
01:15:20,993 --> 01:15:23,518
- It's the best place. No, this way. - No, this way.

1167
01:15:23,596 --> 01:15:28,226
No, no, no. This way, come on. You're no help at all.

1168
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:31,030
What's wrong with you?

1169
01:15:31,102 --> 01:15:34,265
Let go of me, Joel!

1170
01:15:46,283 --> 01:15:47,910
I like watching you work, Howard.

1171
01:15:52,022 --> 01:15:54,513
I guess, uh...

1172
01:15:54,591 --> 01:15:57,389
I guess I'll go out for... for some air,

1173
01:15:57,460 --> 01:15:59,451
if nobody minds.

1174
01:15:59,529 --> 01:16:02,726
It looks like you have everything under control here.

1175
01:16:02,799 --> 01:16:04,733
Yeah, that's, uh...

1176
01:16:04,801 --> 01:16:06,735
that's fine.

1177
01:16:16,445 --> 01:16:19,437
Do you like quotes, Howard?

1178
01:16:20,514 --> 01:16:22,448
What do you mean?

1179
01:16:22,516 --> 01:16:25,212
Oh, you know, like famous quotes?

1180
01:16:25,286 --> 01:16:27,447
I find reading them inspirational,

1181
01:16:27,521 --> 01:16:31,423
and in my reading, I've come across some I thought you might like too.

1182
01:16:31,492 --> 01:16:35,155
Oh, well, I... I'd love to hear some.

1183
01:16:35,228 --> 01:16:37,662
There's one that goes,

1184
01:16:37,731 --> 01:16:41,223
"Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."

1185
01:16:41,301 --> 01:16:43,235
- That's Nietzsche, right? - Yeah.

1186
01:16:43,303 --> 01:16:46,295
- And here I thought I could tell you something you didn't know. - Oh, no.

1187
01:16:46,371 --> 01:16:49,499
It's... It's a good quote. I'm happy we both know it.

1188
01:16:49,575 --> 01:16:52,567
Yeah. Oh, and there's this other one I like.

1189
01:16:52,644 --> 01:16:55,477
It's by Pope Alexander and it goes...

1190
01:16:55,547 --> 01:16:58,015
- Alexander Pope? - Oh, yeah.

1191
01:16:58,082 --> 01:17:00,016
Yeah, shit.

1192
01:17:00,084 --> 01:17:03,918
It's just that I told myself not to say "Pope Alexander" and sound like a dope,

1193
01:17:03,988 --> 01:17:05,979
and then I go ahead and say it.

1194
01:17:06,057 --> 01:17:09,584
- It's no big deal. - You're such a sweetheart.

1195
01:17:11,428 --> 01:17:15,364
The quote goes, "How happy is the blameless Vestal's lot?

1196
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:19,694
"The world forgetting, by the world forgot.

1197
01:17:19,770 --> 01:17:24,104
"Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind.

1198
01:17:24,173 --> 01:17:27,734
Each prayer accepted and each wish resigned."

1199
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:32,770
I want to be a great big, huge elephant...

1200
01:17:32,848 --> 01:17:35,316
with a huge trunk like that.

1201
01:17:36,718 --> 01:17:39,653
Clem? Clementine?

1202
01:17:39,721 --> 01:17:42,690
I haven't heard that one. It's lovely.

1203
01:17:42,757 --> 01:17:45,726
I just thought it would be appropriate, maybe.

1204
01:17:50,397 --> 01:17:54,060
I really admire the work you do, Howard.

1205
01:17:54,134 --> 01:17:56,625
- I don't mean to be so familiar. - Oh, it's fine. It's fine.

1206
01:17:56,703 --> 01:17:59,228
I-I-I-I-I... I'm happy to hear...

1207
01:18:03,009 --> 01:18:06,001
I'm sorry.

1208
01:18:10,049 --> 01:18:12,381
I've loved you for a very long time.

1209
01:18:15,654 --> 01:18:17,986
- I shouldn't have said that. - Oh, Mary, no.

1210
01:18:18,056 --> 01:18:21,287
It's... You're a wonderful girl.

1211
01:18:21,359 --> 01:18:25,056
But I... You know, I have a wife and kids.

1212
01:18:25,129 --> 01:18:27,063
You know I have a wife and kids.

1213
01:18:27,131 --> 01:18:29,065
Oh, Mary.

1214
01:18:31,202 --> 01:18:34,069
Oh, Mary, we can't do this.

1215
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:46,071
Oh, whoa.

1216
01:18:50,519 --> 01:18:53,784
Well, good morning, Mrs. Mierzwiak.

1217
01:19:01,195 --> 01:19:03,186
- What? - Oh, my God!

1218
01:19:03,264 --> 01:19:05,789
Who is it?

1219
01:19:10,204 --> 01:19:12,570
Uh...

1220
01:19:18,245 --> 01:19:21,476
Thank you, Stan. Thanks a lot.

1221
01:19:25,217 --> 01:19:28,243
Hollis. Hollis!

1222
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:30,754
Hollis!

1223
01:19:30,823 --> 01:19:32,984
Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Hollis.

1224
01:19:34,293 --> 01:19:36,784
- I knew it, Howard. - Hollis, it didn't start out to be like this.

1225
01:19:36,862 --> 01:19:40,229
I came here to work. Hollis, this is a one-time mistake!

1226
01:19:40,298 --> 01:19:42,766
- I'm a stupid girl with a stupid crush! - Yeah.

1227
01:19:42,834 --> 01:19:45,325
I swear I basically forced him into it!

1228
01:19:46,537 --> 01:19:49,165
Don't be a monster, Howard. Tell the girl.

1229
01:19:51,842 --> 01:19:54,572
Tell me what?

1230
01:19:54,645 --> 01:19:56,636
Oh, you poor kid.

1231
01:19:57,648 --> 01:19:59,741
You can have him.

1232
01:19:59,816 --> 01:20:01,750
You did.

1233
01:20:10,259 --> 01:20:12,250
What?

1234
01:20:16,064 --> 01:20:18,055
Oh, uh,

1235
01:20:23,071 --> 01:20:26,666
we have a history.

1236
01:20:26,741 --> 01:20:29,301
I'm sorry. Y-You wanted the procedure.

1237
01:20:29,376 --> 01:20:31,537
You...

1238
01:20:31,612 --> 01:20:34,103
You wanted it done...

1239
01:20:34,181 --> 01:20:37,480
so you could get past, uh...

1240
01:20:39,185 --> 01:20:41,176
You could... Yeah.

1241
01:20:42,655 --> 01:20:47,615
Um, I have to, uh, finish the work in there.

1242
01:20:47,694 --> 01:20:49,685
It's almost morning.

1243
01:20:50,897 --> 01:20:52,888
We'll talk later.

1244
01:20:53,899 --> 01:20:55,833
Okay?

1245
01:21:06,811 --> 01:21:08,745
Hey.

1246
01:21:12,683 --> 01:21:14,674
Let me give you a lift home.

1247
01:21:24,260 --> 01:21:26,820
Fuck this thing. Damn it.

1248
01:21:26,896 --> 01:21:30,491
- Hi. - Hi.

1249
01:21:30,566 --> 01:21:34,502
Didn't figure you'd show your face around me again.

1250
01:21:34,570 --> 01:21:37,801
I guess I thought you were... humiliated.

1251
01:21:37,873 --> 01:21:39,841
You did run away, after all.

1252
01:21:39,908 --> 01:21:42,672
I just needed to see ya.

1253
01:21:42,744 --> 01:21:45,042
Yeah?

1254
01:21:45,113 --> 01:21:47,843
I'd like to, um,

1255
01:21:47,915 --> 01:21:50,884
take you out or something.

1256
01:21:50,952 --> 01:21:53,512
You're married.

1257
01:21:53,587 --> 01:21:56,021
Not yet. Not married.

1258
01:21:56,089 --> 01:21:58,023
No, I'm not married, no.

1259
01:21:58,091 --> 01:22:01,117
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat I'm high maintenance,

1260
01:22:01,194 --> 01:22:05,756
so, I'm not gonna tiptoe around your marriage...

1261
01:22:05,831 --> 01:22:08,163
or whatever it is you've got going there.

1262
01:22:08,234 --> 01:22:11,362
If you wanna be with me, you're with me.

1263
01:22:11,437 --> 01:22:13,598
Okay.

1264
01:22:13,672 --> 01:22:16,573
Too many guys think I'm a concept, or I complete them,

1265
01:22:16,642 --> 01:22:19,440
or I'm gonna make them alive.

1266
01:22:19,511 --> 01:22:23,140
But I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind.

1267
01:22:23,214 --> 01:22:27,878
- Don't assign me yours. - I remember that speech really well.

1268
01:22:27,952 --> 01:22:31,444
- I had you pegged, didn't I? - You had the whole human race pegged.

1269
01:22:31,522 --> 01:22:33,513
Hmm. Probably.

1270
01:22:35,692 --> 01:22:37,990
I still thought you were gonna save my life,

1271
01:22:38,062 --> 01:22:39,996
even after that.

1272
01:22:40,064 --> 01:22:43,465
Mmm. I know.

1273
01:22:45,802 --> 01:22:47,793
It would be different...

1274
01:22:48,938 --> 01:22:51,338
if we could just give it another go around.

1275
01:22:55,310 --> 01:22:57,676
Remember me.

1276
01:22:57,746 --> 01:22:59,737
Try your best.

1277
01:23:02,084 --> 01:23:04,018
Maybe we can.

1278
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:38,215
Okay, so just tell me what you remember,

1279
01:23:38,283 --> 01:23:40,877
and, uh, then we'll take it from there.

1280
01:23:40,953 --> 01:23:43,183
Okay.

1281
01:23:43,255 --> 01:23:46,156
I liked you immediately.

1282
01:23:46,224 --> 01:23:48,715
You didn't come on to me at all.

1283
01:23:48,793 --> 01:23:51,785
I liked that.

1284
01:23:51,863 --> 01:23:54,832
I was so tongue-tied around you at first.

1285
01:23:54,899 --> 01:23:57,561
I wanted you to think I was smart.

1286
01:23:58,768 --> 01:24:01,100
I couldn't wait to come to work.

1287
01:24:01,171 --> 01:24:04,663
I had these fantasies of us being married...

1288
01:24:04,741 --> 01:24:08,108
and having kids and... just...

1289
01:24:08,178 --> 01:24:10,874
Oh, Howie, I can't do this.

1290
01:24:10,946 --> 01:24:13,540
We agreed it's for the best, Mary.

1291
01:24:13,616 --> 01:24:16,084
Yeah, I know.

1292
01:24:16,152 --> 01:24:18,086
Oh, God.

1293
01:24:17,820 --> 01:24:19,913
- I'll take the bottom and you... - Uh-uh-uh! No, no, no. Here.

1294
01:24:19,989 --> 01:24:21,923
- I can take that. - So you want me to carry that?

1295
01:24:21,990 --> 01:24:24,481
- Help me with that. Can you get the cooler? - Honey, the cooler is...

1296
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:27,154
- That's light, huh? - You can get it. - Oh, I can get that.

1297
01:24:27,229 --> 01:24:29,163
No, no, no, no!

1298
01:24:29,231 --> 01:24:31,392
- Don't take anything. - I can take the plane.

1299
01:24:31,466 --> 01:24:34,458
Put the thing up. Put the gate back up.

1300
01:24:36,704 --> 01:24:39,434
This is the day we met.

1301
01:24:39,507 --> 01:24:42,704
You were down by the surf. I could just make you out in the distance.

1302
01:24:42,777 --> 01:24:44,904
I remember being drawn to you even then.

1303
01:24:44,979 --> 01:24:49,109
I thought, "Wow, how odd. I'm drawn to someone's back."

1304
01:24:50,884 --> 01:24:54,047
You were in that orange sweatshirt that I would come to know so well...

1305
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:56,088
and even hate, eventually.

1306
01:24:56,156 --> 01:25:00,149
At the time I thought, "How cool! An orange sweatshirt."

1307
01:25:00,225 --> 01:25:02,955
Hi there.

1308
01:25:03,028 --> 01:25:04,962
Hi.

1309
01:25:05,030 --> 01:25:07,965
I saw you sitting over here...

1310
01:25:08,033 --> 01:25:09,967
by yourself,

1311
01:25:10,035 --> 01:25:12,936
and I thought, "Thank God.

1312
01:25:13,004 --> 01:25:15,802
Someone normal who doesn't know how to interact at these things either."

1313
01:25:15,873 --> 01:25:18,000
Yeah.

1314
01:25:18,076 --> 01:25:21,102
I don't ever know what to say.

1315
01:25:21,179 --> 01:25:23,909
I'm Clementine.

1316
01:25:23,981 --> 01:25:27,144
Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?

1317
01:25:27,217 --> 01:25:29,447
And then you just took it...

1318
01:25:29,519 --> 01:25:32,044
without waiting for an answer.

1319
01:25:35,591 --> 01:25:38,082
It was so intimate,

1320
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:41,288
like we were already lovers.

1321
01:25:41,364 --> 01:25:44,162
I'm Joel.

1322
01:25:44,233 --> 01:25:46,394
Hi, Joel.

1323
01:25:46,469 --> 01:25:49,700
So, no jokes about my name.

1324
01:25:49,771 --> 01:25:50,790
You mean like...

1325
01:25:50,890 --> 01:25:53,890
Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin' Oh, my darlin' Clementine

1326
01:25:54,309 --> 01:25:56,800
Huckleberry Hound, that sort of thing?

1327
01:25:56,878 --> 01:25:58,903
Yeah. Like that.

1328
01:25:58,980 --> 01:26:00,914
Oh, no jokes. No jokes.

1329
01:26:00,981 --> 01:26:04,712
One of my favorite things when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll.

1330
01:26:04,785 --> 01:26:06,776
Oh.

1331
01:26:08,722 --> 01:26:11,054
I think your name is magical.

1332
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:16,258
This is it, Joel.

1333
01:26:16,329 --> 01:26:18,524
It's gonna be gone soon.

1334
01:26:20,667 --> 01:26:22,999
I know.

1335
01:26:23,069 --> 01:26:25,003
What do we do?

1336
01:26:27,406 --> 01:26:29,897
Enjoy it.

1337
01:26:46,557 --> 01:26:48,855
- You married? - No.

1338
01:26:48,926 --> 01:26:51,554
Let's move into this neighborhood!

1339
01:26:51,628 --> 01:26:53,528
I do sort of live with someone though.

1340
01:26:53,596 --> 01:26:56,963
- Male or female? - What?

1341
01:26:57,033 --> 01:26:59,467
Female. Female.

1342
01:27:01,604 --> 01:27:05,096
At least I'm not barking up the wrong tree.

1343
01:27:07,876 --> 01:27:11,869
- You know these people? - No, of course not. Come on.

1344
01:27:12,881 --> 01:27:14,815
They might have a dog.

1345
01:27:14,882 --> 01:27:18,545
There's no dog.

1346
01:27:18,619 --> 01:27:20,610
What are you doing?

1347
01:27:20,688 --> 01:27:23,953
- It's freezing out. - I can't believe this.

1348
01:27:24,025 --> 01:27:26,994
Hoo-hoo!

1349
01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:30,894
- Clementine! - There we go. Whoo-hoo!

1350
01:27:37,637 --> 01:27:40,231
Come on, man. The water's fine.

1351
01:27:40,306 --> 01:27:43,434
Nobody's coming here tonight. Believe me.

1352
01:27:46,178 --> 01:27:48,112
It's dark.

1353
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:52,173
So, uh, what's your girlfriend's name?

1354
01:27:52,250 --> 01:27:55,481
Naomi, but we're not really... I mean...

1355
01:27:55,553 --> 01:27:57,953
- We're... - Whatever.

1356
01:27:58,022 --> 01:28:02,118
So, this is great. Now I can look for, um, candles, matches...

1357
01:28:02,193 --> 01:28:04,661
and the liquor cabinet.

1358
01:28:04,728 --> 01:28:07,228
Oh, my God.

1359
01:28:12,669 --> 01:28:14,169
I think we should go.

1360
01:28:14,255 --> 01:28:16,849
There's no phone line. What?

1361
01:28:17,273 --> 01:28:19,434
- I think we should go. - Why?

1362
01:28:19,458 --> 01:28:22,002
It's our house... just for tonight.

1363
01:28:22,078 --> 01:28:25,047
We are "David and Ruth Laskin".

1364
01:28:26,182 --> 01:28:28,616
- Which one do you want to be? - Uh...

1365
01:28:28,683 --> 01:28:32,175
I prefer to be Ruth, but I can be flexible.

1366
01:28:33,688 --> 01:28:37,021
What are you do...

1367
01:28:37,092 --> 01:28:39,322
- Alcohol! - Oh, boy.

1368
01:28:39,394 --> 01:28:41,988
So, are you okay with wine?

1369
01:28:42,062 --> 01:28:44,724
- I don't know. - Well, you choose the wine.

1370
01:28:44,799 --> 01:28:49,031
I'm gonna go find the bedroom and slip into something more... Ruth.

1371
01:28:52,439 --> 01:28:55,203
- I'm Ruth-less at the moment. - I really should go.

1372
01:28:56,943 --> 01:29:00,071
I've gotta catch my ride.

1373
01:29:01,915 --> 01:29:04,406
So go.

1374
01:29:04,484 --> 01:29:06,577
I did.

1375
01:29:06,652 --> 01:29:09,519
I thought maybe you were a nut,

1376
01:29:09,588 --> 01:29:12,386
but you were exciting.

1377
01:29:13,492 --> 01:29:15,426
I wish you'd stayed.

1378
01:29:15,494 --> 01:29:18,190
I wish I'd stayed too. Now I wish I'd stayed.

1379
01:29:18,262 --> 01:29:21,322
I wish I'd done a lot of things.

1380
01:29:21,399 --> 01:29:23,731
Oh, God, I wish I had...

1381
01:29:27,705 --> 01:29:30,833
I wish I'd stayed. I do.

1382
01:29:30,907 --> 01:29:35,469
- Well, I came back downstairs, and you were gone. - I walked out. I walked out the door.

1383
01:29:35,545 --> 01:29:38,378
- Why? - I don't know. I felt like a scared little kid.

1384
01:29:38,448 --> 01:29:41,781
I was like... It was above my head. I don't know.

1385
01:29:41,852 --> 01:29:43,786
You were scared?

1386
01:29:43,853 --> 01:29:45,787
Yeah.

1387
01:29:46,822 --> 01:29:49,450
Thought you knew that about me.

1388
01:29:49,525 --> 01:29:53,518
I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation, I think.

1389
01:29:53,596 --> 01:29:57,225
- Was it something I said? - Yeah.

1390
01:30:00,001 --> 01:30:02,401
You said, "So go"...

1391
01:30:02,470 --> 01:30:04,938
with such disdain, you know?

1392
01:30:05,006 --> 01:30:07,634
- Oh, I'm sorry. - It's okay.

1393
01:30:13,213 --> 01:30:15,147
Joely?

1394
01:30:15,215 --> 01:30:18,082
What if you stayed this time?

1395
01:30:20,753 --> 01:30:23,381
I walked out the door.

1396
01:30:23,456 --> 01:30:25,390
There's no memory left.

1397
01:30:25,458 --> 01:30:28,586
Come back and make up a good-bye, at least.

1398
01:30:28,661 --> 01:30:30,595
Let's pretend we had one.

1399
01:30:41,706 --> 01:30:44,197
Bye, Joel.

1400
01:30:44,275 --> 01:30:46,209
I love you.

1401
01:30:46,277 --> 01:30:50,543
Meet me in Montauk.

1402
01:30:54,218 --> 01:30:58,416
I didn't crash the plane. The plane crashed. I didn't crash the plane.

1403
01:30:58,488 --> 01:31:02,584
You were operating the plane with the remote control, and then it crashed.

1404
01:31:02,659 --> 01:31:04,991
It was fucking windy. Come on, man.

1405
01:31:05,061 --> 01:31:07,029
You're stoned, and you're driving.

1406
01:31:07,096 --> 01:31:09,656
Yeah, the pot balances it out. The pot brings you back up.

1407
01:31:09,731 --> 01:31:12,256
That's why I smoke it. If I'm going to be drinking, then I'll smoke it.

1408
01:31:12,334 --> 01:31:15,963
It does. That's a medical fact.

1409
01:31:16,038 --> 01:31:18,472
It was proven on the Science Network.

1410
01:31:18,540 --> 01:31:20,974
- Honey, just watch the road. - I can't see shit.

1411
01:31:23,544 --> 01:31:26,536
I saw you talking to somebody pretty.

1412
01:31:26,614 --> 01:31:29,447
- She was nice. - Yeah, man. Who was that?

1413
01:31:31,552 --> 01:31:34,851
She was, um, just a girl.

1414
01:31:42,362 --> 01:31:45,229
Okay.

1415
01:32:20,231 --> 01:32:22,995
So I gotta... I gotta drop the van off.

1416
01:32:23,066 --> 01:32:25,159
Thanks, Stan. Thanks.

1417
01:32:25,235 --> 01:32:28,568
We'll talk.

1418
01:33:46,577 --> 01:33:48,568
Hey!

1419
01:33:49,645 --> 01:33:51,579
Hey.

1420
01:33:53,049 --> 01:33:55,779
- You got a lot of your stuff there, I see. - Yeah, that's right. My stuff.

1421
01:33:55,851 --> 01:33:59,287
I take it you're not coming back. I wouldn't come back if I was you either.

1422
01:33:59,355 --> 01:34:03,086
- Do you swear you didn't know? - I-I swear.

1423
01:34:03,158 --> 01:34:06,753
- So you didn't do the erasing? - Of course not. God, no.

1424
01:34:06,828 --> 01:34:09,023
And you never even suspected we were together?

1425
01:34:09,097 --> 01:34:13,329
Once, maybe.

1426
01:34:13,401 --> 01:34:16,393
I was coming back from a job, and you were at his car.

1427
01:34:16,470 --> 01:34:19,064
I saw you two talking.

1428
01:34:19,139 --> 01:34:22,870
So I waved to you, and you giggled, you know.

1429
01:34:22,943 --> 01:34:25,241
How'd I look?

1430
01:34:26,679 --> 01:34:28,613
You looked happy.

1431
01:34:28,681 --> 01:34:30,945
Happy with a secret.

1432
01:34:32,352 --> 01:34:34,286
And after that?

1433
01:34:34,354 --> 01:34:37,517
I never saw you two together again like that, so I just...

1434
01:34:37,590 --> 01:34:41,287
I don't know. I just figured I was imagining things.

1435
01:35:00,211 --> 01:35:03,237
Montauk train now boarding on track B. All aboard.

1436
01:35:06,082 --> 01:35:08,573
I really like you, Mary Svevo.

1437
01:35:09,753 --> 01:35:12,051
You know that?

1438
01:35:22,097 --> 01:35:24,065
Thanks.

1439
01:35:57,697 --> 01:35:59,790
Let me get my toothbrush.

1440
01:35:59,865 --> 01:36:02,333
Yeah. Just...

1441
01:36:14,946 --> 01:36:17,506
Where are you, Clem? I'm worried.

1442
01:36:17,581 --> 01:36:21,950
I feel like you're mad at me, and I don't know what I did.

1443
01:36:22,019 --> 01:36:24,783
What did I do?

1444
01:36:24,855 --> 01:36:27,323
I love you so much.

1445
01:36:27,391 --> 01:36:29,382
I'll do anything to make you happy.

1446
01:36:29,459 --> 01:36:31,723
Tell me what you want me to do, and I'll do it.

1447
01:36:31,794 --> 01:36:35,560
Listen, I'm gonna stop by this morning just to make sure you're okay.

1448
01:36:35,631 --> 01:36:37,565
Oh. Whew.

1449
01:36:48,376 --> 01:36:51,573
Vámonos, señor.

1450
01:36:51,646 --> 01:36:54,809
I-I had a really nice time last night.

1451
01:36:54,882 --> 01:36:57,510
Nice?

1452
01:36:57,585 --> 01:37:00,816
I had the best fucking night of my entire fucking life...

1453
01:37:00,888 --> 01:37:02,822
last night.

1454
01:37:02,390 --> 01:37:04,381
That's better.

1455
01:37:07,494 --> 01:37:11,692
- This is weird. - To all patients of Dr. Howard Mierzwiak.

1456
01:37:11,765 --> 01:37:15,257
- My name is Mary Svevo. - "We've met, but you don't remember me.

1457
01:37:15,335 --> 01:37:19,772
I worked for a company you hired to have part of your memory erased."

1458
01:37:19,839 --> 01:37:22,364
- I have since decided that this is a horrible... - Some kind of teaser ad or something.

1459
01:37:22,441 --> 01:37:27,003
In order to correct this, I'm sending everyone's file back to them.

1460
01:37:27,079 --> 01:37:30,674
My name is Clementine Kruczynski.

1461
01:37:30,750 --> 01:37:33,480
I'm here to erase Joel Barish.

1462
01:37:33,551 --> 01:37:35,781
- What is this? - I don't know.

1463
01:37:35,854 --> 01:37:40,450
He's boring. Is that enough reason to erase someone?

1464
01:37:40,525 --> 01:37:44,222
I've been thinking lately how I was before and how I am now,

1465
01:37:44,295 --> 01:37:46,229
and it's like he changed me.

1466
01:37:46,297 --> 01:37:50,063
I feel like I'm always pissy now. I don't like myself when I'm with him. I don't like myself anymore.

1467
01:37:50,134 --> 01:37:54,730
I can't stand to even look at him. That pathetic, wimpy, apologetic smile.

1468
01:37:54,805 --> 01:37:58,002
- That sort of wounded puppy shit he does, you know? - What are you doing?

1469
01:37:58,074 --> 01:38:00,508
- I'm not doing anything. - The bloom is certainly fucking off the rose at this point.

1470
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:03,568
- Are you screwing with me? - No!

1471
01:38:03,646 --> 01:38:06,080
- You are screwing with me. - Joel, I'm not!

1472
01:38:06,149 --> 01:38:10,518
- You clearly are. - Look, let's just take a minute and...

1473
01:38:39,179 --> 01:38:41,113
Patrick, get the fuck away.

1474
01:38:41,181 --> 01:38:43,581
- Oh, sweetheart... - Get the fuck away from me!

1475
01:38:43,650 --> 01:38:46,881
- Can we talk about it? - No! Get the fuck away!

1476
01:39:19,149 --> 01:39:21,413
Joel Barish.

1477
01:39:21,485 --> 01:39:24,249
- Hey, Clementine. - Hey.

1478
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:27,551
Nice to see you. Yeah.

1479
01:39:28,557 --> 01:39:30,491
Yeah.

1480
01:39:30,559 --> 01:39:32,550
Really very educated.

1481
01:39:32,628 --> 01:39:36,064
I mean, she's smart, I think, but not educated.

1482
01:39:36,131 --> 01:39:39,032
I couldn't really talk to her about books, you know?

1483
01:39:39,100 --> 01:39:42,536
She's more of a magazine-reading girl.

1484
01:39:42,604 --> 01:39:46,005
Her vocabulary leaves something to be desired.

1485
01:39:46,074 --> 01:39:48,736
Sometimes... I was embarrassed in public...

1486
01:39:48,809 --> 01:39:50,800
- Hi. - because she would pronounce...

1487
01:39:50,878 --> 01:39:53,642
- library "libary". - Hi.

1488
01:39:53,714 --> 01:39:56,842
Libary. Libary.

1489
01:39:56,917 --> 01:39:58,851
Look what I found.

1490
01:39:58,919 --> 01:40:03,253
I think if there's a truly seductive quality about Clementine,

1491
01:40:03,322 --> 01:40:06,985
it's that her personality promises to take you out of the mundane.

1492
01:40:08,361 --> 01:40:10,693
You made me look skinny.

1493
01:40:10,763 --> 01:40:13,323
Amazing, burning meteorite...

1494
01:40:13,398 --> 01:40:17,698
will carry you to another world where things are exciting.

1495
01:40:17,769 --> 01:40:20,795
But what you quickly learn is that...

1496
01:40:20,872 --> 01:40:23,705
it's really an elaborate ruse.

1497
01:40:23,775 --> 01:40:25,766
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

1498
01:40:27,378 --> 01:40:30,108
- It's okay. - So flashy in a kind of obvious way.

1499
01:40:31,816 --> 01:40:34,376
- But still, it seduces you. - Joel, I really like you.

1500
01:40:34,452 --> 01:40:36,682
I hate that I said mean things about you.

1501
01:40:36,753 --> 01:40:41,213
- Let me turn this off, okay? - Hey, it's... it's only fair.

1502
01:40:42,559 --> 01:40:44,527
Where's the real Clementine?

1503
01:40:44,594 --> 01:40:47,722
I mean, the whole thing with the hair... it's all bullshit.

1504
01:40:47,797 --> 01:40:52,830
- I really like your hair. - Thank you.

1505
01:40:52,901 --> 01:40:54,835
- I do. - The world's a goddamn mess.

1506
01:40:54,903 --> 01:40:58,532
- Is it some kind of a revolt? Change your hair color. - You want a drink or something?

1507
01:40:58,607 --> 01:41:01,337
Do you have any whiskey?

1508
01:41:01,409 --> 01:41:06,711
No, I don't think her sex is... motivated.

1509
01:41:06,781 --> 01:41:09,773
I saw it clearly the last night we were together.

1510
01:41:09,851 --> 01:41:13,252
It wasn't sex. It was just sad.

1511
01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:16,380
Hey. Sorry. I thought there was more.

1512
01:41:16,456 --> 01:41:20,119
The only way Clem thinks she can get people to like her...

1513
01:41:20,193 --> 01:41:23,026
is to fuck 'em...

1514
01:41:23,096 --> 01:41:27,328
or at least dangle the possibility of getting fucked in front of 'em.

1515
01:41:27,399 --> 01:41:30,334
And she's so desperate and insecure...

1516
01:41:30,402 --> 01:41:35,237
that she'll, sooner or later, go around fucking everybody.

1517
01:41:35,307 --> 01:41:38,333
- I don't do that. - I wouldn't think that about you.

1518
01:41:38,409 --> 01:41:41,310
- Because I don't. - I know.

1519
01:41:41,379 --> 01:41:44,610
- Because it really hurts me that you said that because I don't do that. - I'm so sorry.

1520
01:41:44,682 --> 01:41:47,776
I'm sorry about all this. I'm gonna... go.

1521
01:41:47,852 --> 01:41:52,653
I'm a little confused. I don't really think I can be here.

1522
01:41:56,793 --> 01:42:00,456
Um... bye.

1523
01:42:00,531 --> 01:42:03,159
- Bye. - I thought I knew her so well.

1524
01:42:03,232 --> 01:42:06,827
- It was nice meeting you and all. - But I don't know her at all.

1525
01:42:08,137 --> 01:42:11,504
What a loss to spend that much time with someone,

1526
01:42:11,574 --> 01:42:15,476
only to find out that she's a stranger.

1527
01:42:18,780 --> 01:42:20,771
Wait.

1528
01:42:22,450 --> 01:42:24,384
- What? - I don't know.

1529
01:42:24,452 --> 01:42:26,613
- Just wait. Just wait. - What do you want, Joel?

1530
01:42:26,688 --> 01:42:31,216
I don't know. I want you to wait for... just a... while.

1531
01:42:44,771 --> 01:42:47,467
- Okay. - Really?

1532
01:42:47,540 --> 01:42:51,670
I'm not a concept, Joel. I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind.

1533
01:42:51,744 --> 01:42:55,680
- I'm not perfect. - I can't see anything that I don't like about you.

1534
01:42:55,747 --> 01:42:58,443
- Right now I can't. - But you will. But you will.

1535
01:42:58,517 --> 01:43:02,146
You know, you will think of things, and I'll get bored with you and feel trapped...

1536
01:43:02,220 --> 01:43:04,279
because that's what happens with me.

1537
01:43:05,756 --> 01:43:07,690
Okay.

1538
01:43:11,395 --> 01:43:13,386
Okay.

1539
01:43:17,500 --> 01:43:20,663
- Okay. - Okay.

1540
01:43:28,488 --> 01:43:31,188
Change your heart

1541
01:43:34,035 --> 01:43:36,996
Look around you

1542
01:43:42,864 --> 01:43:45,995
Change your heart

1543
01:43:48,101 --> 01:43:51,463
It will astound you

1544
01:43:55,563 --> 01:44:00,037
Now, I need your lovin'

1545
01:44:02,084 --> 01:44:07,750
Like the sunshine

1546
01:44:10,163 --> 01:44:14,628
And everybody's gotta learn sometime

1547
01:44:17,394 --> 01:44:22,045
Everybody's gotta learn sometime

1548
01:44:24,474 --> 01:44:28,827
Everybody's gotta learn sometime

1549
01:44:31,827 --> 01:44:34,827
